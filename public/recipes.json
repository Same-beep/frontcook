        "answer": "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto is Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).. It requires 6 cups chicken broth, divided ; 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided ; 1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced ; 1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced ; 2  shallots, diced ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups Arborio rice ; \u00bd cup dry white wine ;   sea salt to taste ;   freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives ; 4 tablespoons butter ; \u2153 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese. In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste."

        "answer": "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust is This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.  You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!!  It yields a soft, chewy crust.  For a real treat, I recommend you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy!. It requires 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast ; 1 teaspoon white sugar ; 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups bread flour ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 1 teaspoon salt. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving."

While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. 4. Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined. 5. Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika. 6. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes."

My mother used to serve this with corn on the cob and cornbread. Very inexpensive and very good as well. Enjoy an Ozark memory....

Although the recipe varies from cook to cook and region to region, this is a good attempt at recreating what I ate from Thai-owned hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Okinawa, Japan. Key to the flavor are the sugar levels, unsalted peanuts, peanut oil, and either oyster or fish sauce.. It requires \u00bd cup rice wine vinegar ; \u00bd cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup oyster sauce ; 2 tablespoons tamarind pulp ; 1 (12 ounce) package dried rice noodles ;   cold water, as needed ; \u00bd cup peanut oil ; 4  eggs ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons minced garlic ; 12 ounces chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch strips ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons dried ground Asian radish ; 1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste  ; \u00bd cup chopped fresh chives ; 2 cups fresh bean sprouts ; 1  lime, cut into wedges. Whisk together rice wine vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, oyster sauce, and tamarind pulp in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes; remove from heat and set aside. Place rice noodles in a large bowl and pour enough cold water to cover noodles. Allow to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs and garlic in hot oil until eggs are softly cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir chicken and noodles into eggs and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes.

        "answer": "Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.. It requires 1 pound uncooked spaghetti ; 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced ; \u00bd cup olive oil ; \u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; \u00bc cup chopped fresh Italian parsley ; 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Old Fashioned Onion Rings?",
        "answer": "Old Fashioned Onion Rings is This is an actual recipe from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant. Crispy coated onion rings like the pro's make!. It requires 1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices ; 1\u2009\u00bc cups all-purpose flour ; 1 teaspoon baking powder ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 1  egg ; 1 cup milk, or as needed ; \u00be cup dry bread crumbs ;   seasoned salt to taste ; 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings. Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve."

It was our very favorite Thanksgiving vegetable. If you have children, or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish! Even though I rarely cook with canned condensed soups, I still make this yummy broccoli casserole during the holiday season. It's fabulous with a Christmas ham and potatoes au gratin too. Mmmmmmm!. It requires 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup ; 1 cup mayonnaise ; 1  egg, beaten ; \u00bc cup onions, chopped ; 3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli ; 8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 1 dash paprika. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together condensed soup, mayonnaise, egg and onions. Place frozen broccoli into a very large mixing bowl. (I like to use my large stainless steel bowl to mix this recipe thoroughly.) Break up the frozen broccoli. Using a rubber spatula, scrape soup-mayonnaise mixture on top of broccoli, and mix well. Sprinkle on cheese, and mix well. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish, and smooth top of casserole. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Absolute Best Liver and Onions?",
        "answer": "Absolute Best Liver and Onions is This recipe will turn liver haters into converts.  Very simple! The three things that will set your liver above all others are: 1) soak in milk, 2)turn liver as little as possible and 3) don't overcook!. It requires 2 pounds sliced beef liver ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups milk, or as needed ; \u00bc cup butter, divided ; 2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings ; 2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed ;   salt and pepper to taste. Gently rinse liver slices under cold water, and place in a medium bowl. Pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions. (I like to soak up to an hour or two - whatever you have time for.)  This step is SO important in taking the bitter taste of the liver out. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Separate onion rings, and saute them in butter until soft. Remove onions, and melt remaining butter in the skillet. Season the flour with salt and pepper, and put it in a shallow dish or on a plate. Drain milk from liver, and coat slices in the flour mixture. When the butter has melted, turn the heat up to medium-high, and place the coated liver slices in the pan. Cook until nice and brown on the bottom. Turn, and cook on the other side until browned. Add onions, and reduce heat to medium. Cook a bit longer to taste.  Our family prefers the liver to just barely retain a pinkness on the inside when you cut to check. Enjoy!"

It's relatively cheap and easy to make, but maybe more importantly, it's great hot, warm, or room temp. And it's also incredibly versatile.. It requires 2 pounds extra lean ground beef ; 2  green bell peppers, diced ; 1  onion, diced ; 4 cloves garlic, minced ; 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour ; 2 tablespoons brown sugar ; 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste ; 1 teaspoon ground black pepper ;   cayenne pepper, to taste ; 2 cups chicken broth ; 1 cup ketchup ; 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard ; 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce ; 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided. Place ground beef, bell pepper, onion, garlic, flour, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a heavy pot. Place pot over medium-high heat. Break up and stir mixture as it heats. Cook and stir until most of the moisture has evaporated and mixture is crumbly and begins to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick, about 45 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Transfer mixture to oven-proof sauce pan. Top with 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Poke cheese down into the dip with a fork, stirring lightly. Top with remaining cheese. Place pan under broiler; broil until cheese is browned, and mixture is hot and bubbly, about 5 minutes."

The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.. It requires \u2153 cup chicken broth ; 1 tablespoon oyster sauce ; 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed ; 2 teaspoons fish sauce ; 1 teaspoon white sugar ; 1 teaspoon brown sugar ; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil ; 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped ; \u00bc cup sliced shallots ; 4 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper ; 1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves ; 2 cups hot cooked rice. Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended. Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute. Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice."

      {
        "question": "What is the recipe for How to Make Perfect Polenta?",
        "answer": "How to Make Perfect Polenta is Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a perfect base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.. It requires 4 cups water ; 1 teaspoon fine salt ; 1 cup polenta ; 3 tablespoons butter, divided ; \u00bd cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish. Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly into boiling water, whisking constantly until all polenta is stirred in and there are no lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes. When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender. Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until butter partially melts; mix  1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand 5 minutes to thicken; stir and taste for salt before transferring to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish."

        "answer": "Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo is I am going to give you my gumbo recipe. I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!. It requires 1 cup all-purpose flour ; \u00be cup bacon drippings ; 1 cup coarsely chopped celery ; 1 large onion, coarsely chopped ; 1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 1 pound andouille sausage, sliced ; 3 quarts water ; 6 cubes beef bouillon ; 1 tablespoon white sugar ;   salt to taste ; 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco\u00ae), or to taste ; \u00bd teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's\u00ae), or to taste ; 4  bay leaves ; \u00bd teaspoon dried thyme leaves ; 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes ; 1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce ; 4 teaspoons file powder, divided ; 2 tablespoons bacon drippings ; 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed ; 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar ; 1 pound lump crabmeat ; 3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined ; 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Make a roux by whisking the flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings together in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat to form a smooth mixture. Cook the roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. Place the celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until the vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir the vegetables into the roux, and mix in the sausage. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside. Bring the water and beef bouillon cubes to a boil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Stir until the bouillon cubes dissolve, and whisk the roux mixture into the boiling water. Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in the sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer the soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in a skillet, and cook the okra with vinegar over medium heat for 15 minutes; remove okra with slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Just before serving, stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder."

It requires 1 tablespoon ground cumin ; 1 tablespoon chili powder ; 1 tablespoon paprika ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 3 pounds baby back pork ribs ; 1 cup barbeque sauce. Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate. In a small jar, combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Close the lid, and shake to mix. Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small, sharp knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the membrane as much as possible. Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides of the ribs as desired. To prevent the ribs from becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly rub the spices into the ribs. Store the unused portion of the spice mix for future use. Place aluminum foil on lower rack to capture drippings and prevent flare-ups. Lay the ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from the coals, if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low, close lid, and leave undisturbed for 1 hour. Do not lift the lid at all.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Chicken Paprikash?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Chicken Paprikash is After many, many requests, I'm excited to be sharing what is my second favorite Hungarian dish of all time. I really love making anything Hungarian, since the recipes tend to be simple and easy to make, as well as comforting and delicious, and the names are never not fun to say. Top with extra sour cream and freshly sliced chives on top.. It requires 8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs ;   salt to taste ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 2 medium yellow onions, diced ; 3 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 tablespoons tomato paste ; 4 teaspoons all-purpose flour ; 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste ; \u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 teaspoon smoked paprika ; \u00bc cup sweet Hungarian paprika ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper ; 2 cups chicken broth ; \u2154 cup sour cream, room temperature ; \u00bc cup heavy whipping cream. Season chicken generously on both sides with salt. Heat olive oil in a heavy, deep-sided pan (that comes with a lid) over high heat and brown the chicken well, skin-side down, about 5 minutes; flip and continue to sear until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Turn off heat. Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and reserve until needed; spoon out excess chicken fat if desired. Add onions and a pinch of salt to the same pan and saute over medium until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, tomato paste, and flour and cook, stirring, another 3 to 4 minutes to form a tomato roux. Stir in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, smoked paprika, and sweet paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and transfer chicken and accumulated juices back into the pan. Baste the tops with the sauce, cover the pan with the lid, and simmer, basting occasionally with the sauce, until the chicken is no longer pink in the centers and is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate. Skim some fat off the top of the sauce if desired. Whisk heavy cream and sour cream into the sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Transfer the chicken and any juices back into the sauce. Simmer, uncovered, basting often, until chicken is heated through and very tender, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed."

Like most sweet loaves, it tastes best when allowed to sit for a day, wrapped in plastic wrap.. It requires 1  lemon ; 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar ; \u00be cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup melted butter ; 2  eggs ; \u00bc cup sour cream ; \u2153 cup milk ; 1\u2009\u2154 cups all-purpose flour ; 2 teaspoons baking powder ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; 1\u2009\u00bc cups frozen blueberries. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Grate the zest from the lemon onto a small plate. Cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice from both halves. Make a topping by whisking together 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. Whisk together the white sugar, melted butter, eggs, sour cream, the remaining lemon zest, and the remaining lemon juice in a large bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the milk; set aside. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Remove 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture and set aside.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Remove from oven; immediately poke holes all over the top of the loaf with a toothpick, and pour the topping evenly over the loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. 7. Remove from oven; immediately poke holes all over the top of the loaf with a toothpick, and pour the topping evenly over the loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack."

I've made this numerous times for my picky eater son and my southern-raised better half, as well as other family and friends. I get nothing but rave reviews each time.. It requires 4 (1/2 pound) beef cube steaks ; 2 cups all-purpose flour ; 2 teaspoons baking powder ; 1 teaspoon baking soda ; 1 teaspoon black pepper ; \u00be teaspoon salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups buttermilk ; 1  egg ; 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco\u2122) ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 3 cups vegetable shortening for deep frying ; \u00bc cup all-purpose flour ; 4 cups milk ;   kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste. Pound the steaks to about 1/4-inch thickness. Place 2 cups of  flour in a shallow bowl. Stir together the baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt in a separate shallow bowl; stir in the buttermilk, egg, Tabasco Sauce, and garlic. Dredge each steak first in the flour, then in the batter, and again in the flour. Pat the flour onto the surface of each steak so they are completely coated with dry flour. Heat the shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fry the steaks until evenly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Place fried steaks on a plate with paper towels to drain. Drain the fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid and as much of the solid remnants as possible. Return the skillet to medium-low heat with the reserved oil. Whisk the remaining flour into the oil. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer, cook until thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Spoon the gravy over the steaks to serve."

I've used the combination of pork, beef and veal and they are equally good. Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety...it really does make a difference.. It requires 1 pound ground beef ; \u00bd pound ground veal ; \u00bd pound ground pork ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 2  eggs ; 1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups lukewarm water ; 1 cup olive oil. Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper. Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)"

        "question": "What is the recipe for Enchiladas Verdes?",
        "answer": "Enchiladas Verdes is I learned this recipe from an amazing cook from Puebla. I've been perfecting it for over 15 years and realized that it was time to share it when my foodie friends tried to drink the sauce out of the saucepan. I use the roasted or baked chicken from the grocery store. I did it once only to save time, but found that they are tastier. Be conservative with the cream and the cheese. Do not use sour cream!. It requires 2 cloves garlic ; 3  serrano peppers ; 2\u2009\u00bc pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed ; 1 cup vegetable oil for frying ; 9  corn tortillas ; 3 cups water ; 4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules ; \u00bd  store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded ; \u00bc head iceberg lettuce, shredded ; 1 cup cilantro leaves ; 1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca ; 1 cup grated cotija cheese. Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high. Cook the garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot griddle until toasted and blackened, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers, and 15 minutes for the tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool. Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using kitchen tongs, fry the tortillas individually, turning them once. They shouldn't be in the hot oil for more than 5 seconds per side. Remove excess oil with paper towels and keep warm. Remember that the hotter the oil, the less that the tortillas will absorb. Place the toasted garlic, serrano peppers, tomatillos, and the water in a blender and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve the chicken bouillon into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The sauce shouldn't be too thick. Soak three tortillas in the sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds, fill them with shredded chicken, sprinkle the meat with some of the sauce, roll them and place them seam side down on a pasta bowl. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over them and top them with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour a little more sauce over the whole thing if desired. Repeat the procedure twice more. Serve immediately."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Milk Bread?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Milk Bread is Japanese-style milk bread is easy to make and stays moist and fresh longer than your typical loaf of homemade bread thanks to a starter or \"roux.\" It's light and soft with the perfect amount of sweetness. Try it with my Japanese Egg Salad Sandwich (Tamago Sando) or toast it and use it for a tuna salad sandwich.. It requires \u00bc cup bread flour ; \u00bc cup water ; \u2153 cup whole milk ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups bread flour ; 1\u2009\u00bc teaspoons kosher salt ; \u00bc cup white sugar ; 1 (.25 ounce) package instant dry yeast ; \u00bd cup warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C)) ; 1 large egg, beaten ; 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed ; 1 tablespoon milk, or as needed. Whisk bread flour, water, and milk for starter together in a small saucepan until very smooth. Place over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, until very thick and just about to bubble. If you want to check, it should be at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Pull off the heat and transfer into a measuring cup; you will need exactly 1/2 cup. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Prepare dough: Combine bread flour, cooled starter, salt, sugar, yeast, warm milk, and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Beat on low speed until dough begins to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl, scraping down the sides as needed, about 5 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape dough off the hook and into the bowl. Add butter and knead on low speed until dough is slightly tacky but very smooth and elastic, scraping down the sides as needed, 10 to 12 more minutes. Remove dough from the bowl and shape into a smooth ball. Transfer into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Very generously butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Transfer dough to a work surface (you don't need flour.) Press and knead out all the air and shape into a 9-inch wide rectangle. Starting at one 9-inch side, roll dough lengthwise into a log. Transfer log into the prepared loaf pan with the seam down. Press on dough a bit to be sure it's evenly distributed. Cover the pan and let dough rise until it comes to just about the top of the pan, 35 to 45 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with just enough milk to lightly coat the surface. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the load is beautifully puffed up, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for 10 minutes. Very carefully remove bread and place on a wire rack to cool all the way to room temperature before slicing, about 1 hour."

Combine the orange, lemon, and lime juice in a large glass or ceramic bowl along with the garlic, soy sauce, chipotle pepper, chili power, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, black pepper, and cilantro. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until marinade is well combined.  Remove one cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the meat is cooked. Place the flank steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork.  Add the meat to the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the steak from the marinade and grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium rare. Discard used marinade.  Remove meat from heat and slice across the grain.

        "answer": "1. Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine. 2. Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked. 3. Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. 4. When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. 5. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. 6. Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. 7. Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain. Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately."

Turn the peppers often to blacken all sides. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Rinse cooled peppers under cold water to peel off the skins, and cut a slit along the long side of each pepper to remove the seeds and core. Rinse the peppers inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Stuff the peppers with strips of the cheese. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl with the baking powder. In a second metal bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until the whites form stiff peaks. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk mixture. Place flour into a shallow bowl.

Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume. Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.

Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic.  Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.  Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl.  Divide each half into 12 parts. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square.   Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.  Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns.  At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.  Cover wok with lid.  Steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish \"blisters\" on bun surfaces. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked."

They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream, then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: this was perfect for them and for us even today!. It requires 1 teaspoon salt ; 1 pound bucatini (dry) ; 2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese contains no lumps. Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much. Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed. Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed. Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately."

Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat; cook mushrooms in butter with 1 pinch salt until the mushrooms give off their juices; reduce heat to low. Continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired. Mix onion into mushrooms and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 more minutes. Stir flour into mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes to remove raw flour taste.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Best Turkey Meatloaf?",
        "answer": "Best Turkey Meatloaf is After much trial and error trying to make a more healthy meatloaf, I came up with this recipe. It is important to make this on a baking sheet so the liquids can be drained off the meatloaf. Also, do not put the topping on before the meatloaf has cooked for 30 minutes. Turkey creates a lot of juices, so if you put the topping on first it will become watery and runny.. It requires 1\u2009\u00bd pounds ground turkey ; \u00be cup crushed buttery round crackers ; \u00bd cup milk ; 1 small onion, chopped ; 1  egg ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons salt ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; \u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u00bd cup ketchup ; \u00bc cup brown sugar ; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a jelly roll pan. Mix ground turkey, buttery round cracker crumbs, milk, onion, egg, salt, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl; shape into a loaf and place on the prepared jelly roll pan. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl; set aside. Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from oven and drain liquids. Top meatloaf with ketchup topping. Return loaf to oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)."

It requires 2 teaspoons vegetable oil ; 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic ; \u00bd teaspoon grated fresh ginger root ; \u00bd cup soy sauce ; \u00bd cup water ; \u2154 cup dark brown sugar ; 1 pound beef flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal ; \u00bc cup cornstarch ; 1 cup vegetable oil for frying ; 2 bunches green onions, cut in 2-inch lengths. Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic and ginger until they release their fragrance, about 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce, water, and brown sugar. Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce boils and slightly thickens. Remove sauce from the heat, and set aside. Place the sliced beef into a bowl, and stir the cornstarch into the beef, coating it thoroughly. Allow the beef and cornstarch to sit until most of the juices from the meat have been absorbed by the cornstarch, about 10 minutes. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet or wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Shake excess cornstarch from the beef slices, and drop them into the hot oil, a few at a time. Stir briefly, and fry until the edges become crisp and start to brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the beef from the oil with a large slotted spoon, and allow to drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Pour the oil out of the skillet or wok, and return the pan to medium heat. Return the beef slices to the pan, stir briefly, and pour in the reserved sauce. Stir once or twice to combine, and add the green onions.

Well, the only thing I didn't forget was this special potato gratin that Chef John Schenk taught me how to make 10 years ago at his restaurant Strip House. Not only is it the soul mate of steak, but it's also a great side dish for big holiday gatherings since you can make it the day before and bake when needed..

Bake in the preheated oven until very tender and easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let potatoes cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes. Unwrap.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Skillet Strawberry Shortcake?",
        "answer": "Skillet Strawberry Shortcake is Fresh strawberries are one of the sweetest harbingers of spring and summer. And strawberry shortcakes are most assuredly one of the best ways to celebrate the arrival of warmer, sunnier days. Of course, the petite, layered berry-biscuit stacks aren't exactly fuss-free. This impressive skillet strawberry shortcake recipe eliminates much of the hassle and mess of traditional strawberry shortcakes. Instead of flouring the counter and rolling and cutting out individual biscuits, you'll bake one giant skillet biscuit cake that's topped with macerated strawberries and whipped cream.. It requires 3 cups all-purpose flour ; \u00bd cup white sugar ; 1 tablespoon baking powder ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 1 cup cold buttermilk ; 1 large egg yolk ; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ; 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed ; \u00bd cup sliced strawberries ; 4 cups ripe strawberries, hulled and quartered ; 2 tablespoons white sugar ; 1 medium lemon, zested ; 1 cup heavy whipping cream ; 1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste ; \u00bc teaspoon vanilla extract. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet; line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt for shortcake together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg yolk, and vanilla together in a glass measuring cup until evenly combined; set aside. Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Use a rubbing motion with your fingertips and cut the butter into the flour mixture to distribute. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the center of the well. Use a rubber spatula to mix the flour into the buttermilk mixture to form a moist, shaggy dough. Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet. Smooth the dough to distribute evenly in the pan. Press the sliced strawberries gently into the surface. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and baked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. To prepare the topping, stir together the quartered strawberries, sugar, and lemon zest in a medium mixing bowl to macerate. To prepare the whipped cream, combine whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla in a chilled mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat at medium speed until soft peaks form. Spoon the strawberries and juices over the shortcake. Serve with whipped cream."

        "answer": "Homemade Four Cheese Ravioli is Great homemade Italian ravioli recipe that I have recreated to taste like the ravioli at Maggiano's restaurant. Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it!. It requires 2 cups all-purpose flour ; 1 pinch salt ; 1 teaspoon olive oil ; 2  eggs ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons water ; 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese ; 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened ; \u00bd cup shredded mozzarella cheese ; \u00bd cup provolone cheese, shredded ; 1  egg ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons dried parsley ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 2 cloves garlic, crushed ; 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce ; 2 cups heavy cream ; \u00bc cup grated Parmesan cheese ; 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce ; 1  egg ; 1 tablespoon water. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

Butterflying them makes quick work of the cooking time. Serve with this delicious, fruity salsa, or with your favorite dipping sauce.. It requires 1 cup diced pineapple ; 1 cup diced mango ; \u2153 cup diced red bell pepper ; 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice ; 1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced ; 2 tablespoons minced red onion ; \u00bc cup minced fresh cilantro ;   sea salt to taste ; 1 cup ice, or as needed ; 1 pound raw shrimp ; 1 large egg ; \u215b teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste ;   sea salt to taste ; 2 cups panko bread crumbs ;   parchment paper ;   avocado oil spray ;   lime slices for garnish (optional). Combine pineapple, mango, bell pepper, lime juice, jalapeno pepper, onion, cilantro, and sea salt in a bowl; stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate, until ready to use. Set a bowl of ice on the work space. Clean each shrimp by removing the head with a twisting motion. Cut along the back of the shell with kitchen shears or a sharp paring knife, and peel off the shell, removing the legs with the shell. Reserve heads and shells for stock, if desired. Clean away the vein that runs along the back, and cut deeper into the shrimp, lengthwise, toward the tail, but not all the way through, to butterfly the shrimp. Place each cleaned and butterflied shrimp on the ice. Place egg in a medium bowl and stir to combine the yolk and the white. Season with cayenne pepper and sea salt. Spread panko crumbs on a plate, and cover a second plate with parchment paper. Remove each shrimp from the ice bowl and place into the egg mixture. One by one, remove shrimp from the egg mixture and place on the panko crumbs. Pat panko into the top side, then place each shrimp on the parchment-lined plate. Repeat, until all the shrimp are coated in panko. Spray with avocado oil spray. Place shrimp in a single layer in the air fryer with the sprayed side down without touching each other. Spray the top of the shrimp with avocado oil spray. Air fry at 390 degrees F (195 degrees C) for 4 minutes. Carefully turn shrimp and continue for an additional 3 minutes.

It requires 1 (8 pound) pork shoulder roast  ; 1 quart apple cider, or as needed ; 5 tablespoons white sugar ; 5 tablespoons light brown sugar ; 2 tablespoons kosher salt ; 2 tablespoons paprika ; 1 tablespoon onion powder ; 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 tablespoon garlic powder ; 1  onion, chopped ;   3 cups hickory chips, or more as needed, soaked in water. Place pork shoulder in a large pot and add enough apple cider to cover. Combine white sugar, brown sugar, salt, paprika, onion powder, black pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl. Mix about 1/4 cup sugar rub into cider; reserve remaining rub. Cover pot and refrigerate for 12 hours. Prepare smoker to about 210 degrees F (99 degrees C). Add enough wood chips to smoker. Pour cider brine into the water pan of the smoker; add onion and about 1/4 cup more sugar rub. Spread remaining rub over pork shoulder. Transfer pork to the center of smoker. Smoke pork until very tender, about 8 hours. Monitor hickory chips and liquid, adding more wood and water, respectively, as needed.

Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.. It requires 2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled ; \u00bd cup heavy cream ; 1 teaspoon butter ; 1 small onion, minced ; \u2154 pound ground beef ; \u2153 pound finely ground pork ; 1  egg ; 1 tablespoon brown sugar  (Optional); 1 teaspoon salt ; \u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u00bc teaspoon ground nutmeg ; \u00bc teaspoon ground allspice ; \u215b teaspoon ground ginger  (Optional); 1 tablespoon butter ; \u00bc cup chicken broth ; 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed ; 2 cups beef broth, or as needed ; \u00bd (8 ounce) container sour cream. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the bread crumbs into a small bowl, and mix in the cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb the cream, about 10 minutes. While the bread is soaking, melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until it turns light brown, about 10 minutes. Place onion into a mixing bowl; mix with the ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. Lightly mix in the bread crumbs and cream. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the meat mixture per meatball, and form into balls. Place the meatballs into the skillet, and cook just until the outsides are brown, about 5 minutes, turning the meatballs often. Insides of the meatballs will still be pink. Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish. To make brown gravy, pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the flour into the pan drippings until smooth, and gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups of liquid. Bring the gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly until thick, about 5 minutes. Just before serving, whisk in the sour cream. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Better Than Sex Cake II?",
        "answer": "Better Than Sex Cake II is Rich chocolate cake, caramel, toffee, and whipped topping - need I say more?!. It requires 1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix ; \u00bd (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk ; 6 ounces caramel ice cream topping ; 3 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped ; 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed. Bake cake according to package directions for a 9x13 inch pan; cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Make slits across the top of the cake, making sure not to go through to the bottom. In a saucepan over low heat, combine sweetened condensed milk and caramel topping, stirring until smooth and blended.  Slowly pour the warm topping mixture over the top of the warm cake, letting it sink into the slits; then sprinkle the crushed chocolate toffee bars liberally across the entire cake while still warm. (Hint: I crush my candy bars into small chunks as opposed to crumbs - I like to have pieces I can chew on!) Let cake cool completely, then top with whipped topping. Decorate the top of the cake with some more chocolate toffee bar chunks and swirls of caramel topping. Refrigerate and serve right from the pan!"

And in addition to being delicious to eat, it's also extremely easy to make!. It requires 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast ; 1 cup warm water (90 to 100 degrees F/32 to 38 degrees C) ; 1 cup all-purpose flour ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons olive oil ; 1\u2009\u00be teaspoons salt ; 1\u2009\u00be cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed ; 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided. Place yeast into the work bowl of a stand mixer and add 1 cup warm water and 1 cup flour. Whisk together and let stand 15 to 20 minutes for mixture to rise and make a loose sponge. Mixture will bubble and foam. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt into sponge; add 1 3/4 cup flour. Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly sticky. If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time. Knead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball. Wipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough around in bowl to cover with a thin film of oil; cover bowl with foil and let sit until dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Remove dough from bowl and place onto a floured work surface. Lightly pat into a flat shape about 1 inch thick. Use a knife to cut dough into 8 pieces. Form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom. Cover dough balls with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Sprinkle a small amount of flour on a work surface and top of a dough ball; gently pat dough ball flat with your fingers, forming a flat, round bread about 1/4 inch thick. Let dough round rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Brush a cast-iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Lay pita bread into hot skillet and cook until bread begins to puff up and bottom has brown spots and blisters, about 3 minutes. Flip, cook 2 more minutes, and flip back onto original side to cook for about 30 more seconds. Pita bread will begin to puff up and fill with hot air.

Pour ground tomatoes into slow cooker. Swirl 1/4 cup water in each emptied can and pour into slow cooker. Add sugar, vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, celery salt, mustard powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and whole clove; whisk to combine. Cook on high, uncovered, until mixture is reduced by half and very thick, 10 to 12 hours. Stir every hour or so. Smooth the texture of the ketchup using an immersion blender, about 20 seconds. Ladle the ketchup into a fine strainer and press mixture with the back of a ladle to strain out any skins and seeds. Transfer the strained ketchup to a bowl.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Wool Roll Bread?",
        "answer": "Wool Roll Bread is I've spun quite a few yarns but one thing I've never done is make a bread that looks like a bunch of rolls of wool yarn. If this looks like it's going to be super hard and complicated, that's good-that's exactly what we want people to think. It'll be our little secret how simple and easy this technique is. Although it's great with a dark chocolate filling, this is really a technique recipe and video-this will work with just about any filling you can think of, like dried fruit, jams, custard, or go savory with cheese, meats, etc.. It requires \u00bd cup water ; \u00bc cup all-purpose flour ; \u00bd cup whole milk, warmed ; 2 teaspoons active dry yeast ; 3 tablespoons white sugar ; \u00be teaspoon kosher salt ; 1 large egg, beaten ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups all-purpose flour ; 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature  ; \u00bd cup dark chocolate chunks ; 2 tablespoons whole milk. To make \"water roux,\" whisk together water and flour in a small saucepan and cook, stirring, over medium heat until a very hot, gluey paste is formed. Mixture should reach at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from heat and let cool completely. While roux cools, pour 1/2 cup warm milk and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer and let bloom for 10 minutes. Add the cooled starter, sugar, salt, beaten egg, flour, and butter to the yeast mixture. Using the dough hook, knead on low speed until a smooth, elastic, slightly sticky dough forms, about 10 minutes. Shape dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl; let rise until doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes. Transfer dough to work surface and press into a round disk. Use a bench scraper to cut dough like a pie, into 5 equal wedges. Form each portion into a ball of dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. Generously butter a 10-inch springform pan, or 10-inch round cake pan. Cut a round piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom, place into the pan, and butter that as well. Set aside. Take one ball of dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface into an oblong shape, about 5 inches wide by 9 inches long. Take your bench scraper and make lots of lengthwise cuts, about 1/8 inch apart, starting 1/3 of the way from one of the ends, slicing all the way through the dough to the opposite end, forming many equal-sized strands of dough. When done, two-thirds of the dough will be sliced, and one-third will not be. Roll the unsliced part of the dough to flatten to 1/8-inch thickness. Place a rounded tablespoon of chocolate chunks (or the filling of your choice) in the center of the unsliced dough, and roll it up, tucking in the sides as you go, until the chocolate is covered, and you've reached the beginning of the cuts. Slowly roll up to form a \"wool roll,\" being careful not to crush the sliced edges of the dough strands, finishing with the seam on the bottom. Transfer to the prepared pan, and place on the bottom, just barely touching the edge of the pan. Repeat four more times. Place the rolls around the inside of the pan to form a ring. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough double in size, 45 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush the bread's surface lightly with remaining milk. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Portuguese Custard Tarts (Pasteis de Nata)?",
        "answer": "Portuguese Custard Tarts (Pasteis de Nata) is This slightly streamlined recipe for the world-famous pasteis de nata, or Portuguese custard tarts, uses just few basic ingredients but requires numerous steps and a certain amount of finesse. The results are so worth it, though, you'll want to make a double batch. The extra moisture inside the sticky dough, activated by a very hot oven, creates the signature flaky, buttery, crispy crust, which encases a custard subtly scented with lemon, cinnamon, and vanilla.. It requires 1 cup all-purpose flour ; \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt ; \u2153 cup cold water ; 1 stick high-quality unsalted butter, fully softened, divided ; \u00be cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup water ; 1 tablespoon water ; 1  cinnamon stick  (Optional); 1  lemon, zested in large strips  (Optional); \u2153 cup all-purpose flour ; \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups milk ; 6 large egg yolks ; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  (Optional). Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dough should be sticky; adjust with more flour or water to achieve what's shown in the video. Transfer dough onto a well floured surface. Dust a little more flour over the top. Knead for a minute or two to form a round. Cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll dough into a square about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with flour as necessary; dough should still be sticky. Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the square using a silicone spatula, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Flip the unbuttered side over the middle of the square and fold the opposite end over it like a letter. Straighten the edges as needed. Turn dough with a bench scraper to unstick it from the counter; dust with flour. Flip and sprinkle more flour on top. Roll dough into a 1/8-inch-thick rectangle, carefully stretching edges as needed. Spread another 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the dough. Fold into thirds. Transfer onto a lined baking sheet and freeze until butter is slightly chilled, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle dough with flour and roll into a square a little over 1/8 inch thick. Spread remaining butter over the dough, leaving a 1- to 1 1/2-inch border on the top edge. Dip your finger in water and lightly moisten the unbuttered edge. Roll dough into a log starting from the bottom edge. Dust with more flour and polish the ends as needed. Seal with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Combine sugar, 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water, cinnamon, and lemon zest in a pot. Boil over medium heat, without stirring, until syrup reaches 210 to 215 degrees F (100 degrees C). Remove from heat. Preheat oven 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin. Whisk flour, salt, and cold milk together very thoroughly in a cold pot. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until milk thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes. Whisk egg yolks into the cooled milk. Add the sugar syrup and vanilla extract. Mix until combined. Strain custard into a glass measuring cup. Unwrap the dough and trim any uneven bits on the ends. Score log into 12 even pieces using a knife; cut through. Place a piece of dough in each muffin cup. Dip your thumb lightly in some cold water. Press thumb into the center of the swirl; push dough against the bottom and up the sides of the cup until it reaches least 1/8 inch past the top. Fill each cup 3/4 of the way with custard. Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is browned and bubbly, and the tops start to blister and caramelize, about 12 minutes. Cool tarts briefly and serve warm."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Nashville Hot Chicken?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Nashville Hot Chicken is If you've never had Nashville Hot Chicken, we're talking about an ultra-crispy fried chicken doused with a cayenne-infused glaze, and by 'glaze' I mean melted butter and lard.\u00a0For the record,\u00a0I've never been to Nashville, so I can't tell you how authentic this is, but it works for me, and is fairly easy to pull off.. It requires 1  whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces ; 1 tablespoon kosher salt ; 1 cup buttermilk ; \u00bc cup pickle brine ; 2 tablespoons Louisiana-style hot sauce ; 1  large egg ; 2 cups all-purpose flour ; 2 teaspoons fine table salt ; \u00bc cup butter ; \u00bc cup lard ; 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper ; 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar ; 1 teaspoon paprika ; \u00bd teaspoon garlic powder ; \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt ; \u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed. Toss chicken pieces with 1 tablespoon kosher salt. Transfer chicken to a bowl; cover and refrigerate overnight. Whisk buttermilk, pickle brine, hot sauce, and egg together in a mixing bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and stir to ensure each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and let chicken marinate in refrigerator 2 to 4 hours. Mix flour and salt together in a shallow flat dish. Remove chicken from marinade and blot with paper towels. Reserve marinade. Toss chicken in flour until thoroughly coated. Return chicken to marinade, coating all sides; remove chicken from marinade allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Coat the chicken once again in flour mixture. Place on a rack. Repeat with all chicken pieces. Allow to sit out about 15 minutes to allow coating to dry out a bit. Place butter and lard in a large pot. Add cayenne pepper, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. Place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until fats melt. Remove from heat; keep sauce warm. Fill cast iron skillet about 1/3 of the way with vegetable oil. Heat oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Carefully place chicken into hot oil, skin side down. Maintain an oil temperature of 325 degrees F, adjusting heat as need. Fry until instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a rack to drain. Brush with the sauce on both sides."

Refrigerate the patties for 30 minutes. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the cornmeal into a shallow dish and dredge each patty in the cornmeal, pressing lightly so that the cornmeal adheres to both sides of the patties. Working in batches, cook the patties in the oil until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side."

        "answer": "Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork) is \"Char siu\" literally means \"fork roast\" - \"char\" being \"fork\" (both noun and verb) and \"siu\" being \"roast\" - after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. This is best cooked over charcoal, but it's important to cook with indirect heat.. It requires 2  pork tenderloins ; \u00bd cup soy sauce ; \u2153 cup honey ; \u2153 cup ketchup ; \u2153 cup brown sugar ; \u00bc cup Chinese rice wine ; 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce ; \u00bd teaspoon red food coloring  (Optional); 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder  (Optional). Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag. Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring or red bean curd (see Cook's Note), and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade. Marinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade. Cook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)."

I have been making it for 30 years and it never fails to please. It makes an exquisite presentation, too!. It requires 4 tablespoons butter ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 2 large red onions, thinly sliced ; 2 large sweet onions, thinly sliced ; 1 (48 fluid ounce) can chicken broth ; 1 (14 ounce) can beef broth ; \u00bd cup red wine ; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce ; 2 sprigs fresh parsley ; 1 sprig fresh thyme leaves ; 1  bay leaf ; 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 4 thick slices French or Italian bread  ; 8 slices Gruyere or Swiss cheese slices, room temperature ; \u00bd cup shredded Asiago or mozzarella cheese, room temperature ; 4 pinches paprika. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in salt, red onions and sweet onions. Cook 35 minutes, stirring frequently, until onions are caramelized and almost syrupy. Mix chicken broth, beef broth, red wine and Worcestershire sauce into pot. Bundle the parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with twine and place in pot.  Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard the herbs. Reduce the heat to low, mix in vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep over low heat to stay hot while you prepare the bread. Preheat oven broiler. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and broil 3 minutes, turning once, until well toasted on both sides. Remove from heat; do not turn off broiler. Arrange 4 large oven safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill each bowl 2/3 full with hot soup. Top each bowl with 1 slice toasted bread, 2 slice Gruyere cheese and 1/4 of the Asiago or mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle a little bit of paprika over the top of each one. Broil 5 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. As it softens, the cheese will cascade over the sides of the crock and form a beautifully melted crusty seal. Serve immediately!"

        "answer": "German Potato Dumplings (Kartoffelkloesse) is The latest German import to my potato side dish collection are these soft, comforting dumplings drizzled in browned butter and topped with, sorry, not bacon, but something even better! Just try it to find out what it is. For best results, roast, don't boil, the potatoes so they're nice and dry. Yes, you can top these dumplings with bacon anyway, and/or saut\u00e9ed onions and mushroom sauce. I served mine with sausage and red cabbage.. It requires 2 large russet potatoes ; 1 stick unsalted butter ; 2 cups fresh bread cubes ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste ; 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste ; 2 large eggs ; 1 cup all-purpose flour ; 1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives, or to taste. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and let cool until easily handled. Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread cubes; cook and stir until golden brown and crunchy, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer bread to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Reserve the browned butter in the pan. Peel potatoes and place them in a large bowl. Mash and season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg. Stir in eggs and mash until combined. Add flour; stir just until flour disappears. Do not overmix dough. Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer. Dampen hands with water and scoop a spoonful of the dough onto your palm. Shape into a circle, make a light indentation in the center, and place 2 or 3 croutons inside. Roll into a smooth ball, sealing in the croutons. Repeat with remaining dough and croutons. Use a large spoon to lower dumplings into the simmering water, one at a time. Cook until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until set, flipping dumplings over halfway, until 20 minutes. Place dumplings on a serving plate. Drizzle with reserved browned butter. Crumble remaining croutons on top and garnish with chives. Let dumplings firm up slightly before serving, about 10 minutes."

        "answer": "Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara is My wife and I went to that popular Italian-American restaurant chain for dinner recently, and I had their shrimp and chicken carbonara. It was absolutely delicious and I thought, 'What the heck, I'll try making this at home.' I found a few recipes online, but none grabbed me. After studying several recipes, I came up with this recipe on my own. It's fairly simple to make, and my wife said it was better than the original.. It requires 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided ; 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces ; 3 tablespoons minced garlic, divided ; 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning ; 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined ; 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta ; 8 slices smoked bacon, diced ; 1  onion, diced ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups heavy whipping cream ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups grated Parmesan cheese ; 4  egg yolks ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; \u00bc cup Sauvignon Blanc wine. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken with 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same pan. Fry shrimp until red on the outside and white on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes. Place with the chicken. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain. Add bacon to the pan; cook until just crispy, not crunchy, about 6 minutes. Drain on 2 paper towels. Saute onion in the bacon grease until translucent, about 5 minutes. While onion is sauteeing, mix cream, Parmesan cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and remaining Italian seasoning together in a bowl. Pour wine into the pan with the onions. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Cook until wine is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the creamy egg mixture and reduce heat. Simmer until sauce begins to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken and shrimp; mix to coat. Serve on top of pasta."

        "answer": "Traditional Gyro Meat is This Greek/Lebanese style meatloaf is sliced and served with pita bread, tzatziki, and tomatoes for a delicious gyro that is the closest I've come to emulating my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. The preparation time seems long, but most of it is resting time, so you can be doing other stuff! You can substitute pork or chicken for the ground lamb and beef if you prefer.. It requires \u00bd  onion, cut into chunks ; 1 pound ground lamb ; 1 pound ground beef ; 1 tablespoon minced garlic ; 1 teaspoon dried oregano ; 1 teaspoon ground cumin ; 1 teaspoon dried marjoram ; 1 teaspoon ground dried rosemary ; 1 teaspoon ground dried thyme ; 1 teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u00bc teaspoon sea salt. Place the onion in a food processor, and process until finely chopped. Scoop the onions onto the center of a towel, gather up the ends of the towel, and squeeze out the liquid from the onions. Place the onions into a mixing bowl along with the lamb and beef. Season with the garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, and salt. Mix well with your hands until well combined. Cover, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the meat mixture into the food processor, and pulse for about a minute until finely chopped and the mixture feels tacky. Pack the meat mixture into a 7x4 inch loaf pan, making sure there are no air pockets. Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel.  Place the loaf pan on the towel, inside the roasting pan, and place into the preheated oven.  Fill the roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the loaf pan. Bake until the gyro meat is no longer pink in the center, and the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F (75 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly before slicing thinly and serving."

        "answer": "Banh Mi is A Vietnamese sandwich, made with chicken and full of pickled vegetables. My husband works around a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I was making him bring me home these tasty sandwiches. Finally I attempted to make one, and found that my recipe was even better than the restaurants, mainly because I used chicken breast and fresher ingredients. I also love the pickled vegetables, so I made sure there was plenty of those.. It requires \u00bd cup rice vinegar ; \u00bc cup water ; \u00bc cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup carrot, cut into 1/16-inch-thick matchsticks ; \u00bc cup white (daikon) radish, cut into 1/16-inch-thick matchsticks ; \u00bc cup thinly sliced white onion ; 1  skinless, boneless chicken breast half ;   garlic salt to taste ;   ground black pepper to taste ; 1 (12 inch) French baguette ; 4 tablespoons mayonnaise ; \u00bc cup thinly sliced cucumber  ; 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves ; 1 small jalapeno pepper - seeded and cut into 1/16-inch-thick matchsticks ; 1 wedge lime. Place rice vinegar, water, and sugar into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl, and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes. Drain off the excess vinegar mixture after the vegetables have marinated. While the vegetables are marinating, preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan. Sprinkle the chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper, and broil on slotted broiler pan, turning once, until the center of the chicken breast is no longer pink and the surface has browned, about 6 minutes per side. Remove the broiled chicken, and slice into bite-size pieces. Slice the baguette in half the long way, and pull the center of the bread out of the baguette halves, leaving a cavity for the filling. Place the baguette halves under the broiler to lightly toast, 2 to 3 minutes. To assemble the bahn mi sandwich, spread each half of the toasted baguette with mayonnaise, and fill the cavity of the bottom half of the bread with broiled chicken, cucumber slices, pickled carrot, onion, and radish, cilantro leaves, and jalapeno pepper. Squeeze a wedge of lime over the filling, and top with the other half of the baguette."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Fondant Potatoes?",
        "answer": "Fondant Potatoes is The texture this old-school method provides for russet potatoes is unlike anything you get by just roasting: so dense, moist, and rich. The way the crusty, crunchy edges outside contrast with the uniquely rich and creamy inside is truly a magical thing.. It requires 3 large whole russet potatoes ; 2 tablespoons high-heat-resistant vegetable oil, such as grapeseed oil ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 3 tablespoons butter ; 4 sprigs thyme, plus more for garnish ; \u00bd cup chicken broth, or more as needed. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cut off ends of russet potatoes, stand potatoes on end, and peel potatoes from top to bottom with a sharp knife to make each potato into a uniform cylinder. Cut each cylinder in half crosswise to make 6 potato cylinders about 2 inches long. Place potatoes into a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes to remove starch from outsides; pat dry with paper towels. Place a heavy oven-proof skillet (such as a cast iron skillet) over high heat. Pour in vegetable oil; heat oil until it shimmers slightly. Place potato cylinders with best-looking ends into the hot oil, lower heat to medium-high, and pan-fry potatoes until well-browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Flip the potatoes onto the opposite ends. As they cook, use a paper towel held with tongs to carefully blot out the oil from the skillet. Add butter and thyme sprigs to skillet. Pick up a thyme sprig with tongs and use it to paint butter over the top of the potatoes. Cook until butter foams and foam turns from white to a pale tan color. Season with more salt and pepper. Pour chicken stock into skillet. Transfer skillet to preheated oven and cook until potatoes are tender and creamy inside, about 30 minutes. If potatoes aren't tender, add 1/4 cup more stock and let cook 10 more minutes. Place potatoes on a serving platter and spoon thyme-scented butter remaining in skillet over potatoes. Garnish with thyme sprigs. Let cool about 5 minutes before serving."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms?",
        "answer": "Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms is A great from-scratch salisbury steak and gravy recipe I found a long time ago. The mushroom and onion gravy is wonderful over mashed potatoes or rice. The gravy is still good without mushrooms. I've made it for my husband that way.. It requires 1 pound lean ground beef ; \u2153 cup dry bread crumbs ; \u00bc cup chopped onions ; 1  egg, beaten ; 1 teaspoon salt ; \u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper ; 2 cups beef broth ; 1 large onion, thinly sliced ; 1 cup sliced mushrooms ; 3 tablespoons cornstarch ; 3 tablespoons water. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick. Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. Transfer patties to a platter and keep warm. Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion gravy is thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Old Fashioned Pineapple Upside-Down Cake?",
        "answer": "Old Fashioned Pineapple Upside-Down Cake is This old-fashioned cake recipe delivers a really good take on the dessert classic: pineapple upside-down cake.. It requires 4  eggs ; \u00bd cup butter ; 1 cup packed light brown sugar ; 1 (20 ounce) can sliced pineapple ; 10  maraschino cherries, halved ; 1 cup sifted cake flour ; 1 teaspoon baking powder ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; 1 cup white sugar ; 1 tablespoon butter, melted ; 1 teaspoon almond extract. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a 10-inch heavy skillet with a heat-resistant handle (I use a cast iron skillet), melt 1/2 cup butter over very low heat. Remove from heat, and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over pan. Arrange pineapple slices to cover bottom of skillet. Distribute cherries around pineapple; set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs into two bowls. In a large bowl, beat egg whites just until soft peaks form. Add granulated sugar gradually, beating well after each addition. Beat until medium-stiff peaks form. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks at high speed until very thick and yellow. With a wire whisk or rubber scraper, using an over-and-under motion, gently fold egg yolks and flour mixture into whites until blended. Fold in 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine and almond extract. Spread batter evenly over pineapple in skillet. Bake until surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Loosen the edges of the cake with table knife. Cool the cake for 5 minutes before inverting onto serving plate."

        "answer": "Perfect Pot Stickers is Homemade pot stickers are so versatile--you can fill them with anything you want and as full as you want. And the play between the crispy, crusty bottom, and the tender parts, makes for a truly unique dumpling.\u00a0These are filled with ground pork, green onions, ginger, and cabbage.. It requires 1 pound ground pork ; 4 cloves minced garlic ; \u00bd cup finely chopped green onions ; 3 tablespoons very finely minced fresh ginger ; 2 tablespoons soy sauce ; 1 teaspoon soy sauce ; 1 teaspoon sesame oil ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups finely chopped green cabbage ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups all-purpose flour ; \u00be teaspoon kosher salt ; 1 cup hot water, about 130 -150 F (55-65 C) ; \u00bc cup seasoned rice vinegar ; \u00bc cup soy sauce ; 6 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided ; 8 tablespoons water for steaming, divided. Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour. Place flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, about 3 to 5 minutes. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes. When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming \"pleats\" along one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Mix together seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small mixing bowl for the dipping sauce. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers.

        "answer": "Air Fryer French Fries is Since I missed the whole Instant Pot\u00ae train, I had to make at least one air fryer recipe while they're still hot. And it doesn't get more classic than French fries; the generally accepted technique is pretty, dare I say, airtight, at this point, but I do have one extra trick in store! Finally, dip them in honey mustard, spicy ketchup, garlic aioli, or all 3 mixed together, like I did.. It requires 1 pound russet potatoes, peeled ; 2 teaspoons vegetable oil ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper ; \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt. Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices. Slice sections into sticks also about 3/8 inch-wide. Cover potatoes with water and let soak for 5 minutes to release excess starches. Drain and cover with boiling water by a few inches (or place in a bowl of boiling water). Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off the excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes. Transfer into a mixing bowl; drizzle with oil, season with cayenne, and toss to coat. Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket. Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries; continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately."

So I tried batter - after all it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes.  Now even my husband can't get enough of these French fries.  They even stay crispy when you reheat in the microwave.. It requires 2\u2009\u00bd pounds russet potatoes, peeled ; 1 cup all-purpose flour ; 1 teaspoon garlic salt ; 1 teaspoon onion salt ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 1 teaspoon paprika ; \u00bd cup water, or as needed ; 1 cup vegetable oil for frying. Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon. Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Baked Fresh Rainbow Trout?",
        "answer": "Baked Fresh Rainbow Trout is Very easy and tasty recipe I invented one day with ingredients on hand, for fresh rainbow trout (farmed or wild) that my family loves. It takes very little time and is much lighter than ocean fish. I use whole fish you can buy already  gutted from the supermarket, with heads and tails still on. Make sure you pick trout that are really, really fresh. I find the dish doesn't even need lemon slices but you can use them if you like. The key is to remember to add the water to the dish as instructed in directions, which keeps fish from drying out. Serve with rice and veggies. Light and delicious. Be careful of bones! Make sure to add hot water to the dish; cold water can crack the baking dish.. It requires 2 teaspoons olive oil, or to taste ; 2  whole rainbow trout, gutted and cleaned, heads and tails still on ; \u00bc teaspoon dried dill weed ; \u00bc teaspoon dried thyme ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; \u00bd large onion, sliced ; 2 thin slices lemon  (Optional); 2 tablespoons hot water. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with about 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place trout in the prepared baking dish and coat with remaining olive oil. Season the inside and outside of fish with dill, thyme, and salt. Stuff each fish with onion slices; grind pepper over the top. Place 1 lemon slice on each fish. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; add water to dish. Continue baking until fish flake easily with a fork, about 10 minutes more."

Technically shish kabobs use lamb, so these should be called beef kabobs, but this is the family recipe and what we call it.. It requires \u2153 cup vegetable oil ; \u00bd cup soy sauce ; \u00bc cup lemon juice ; 1 tablespoon prepared mustard ; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce ; 1 clove garlic, minced ; 1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd pounds lean beef, cut into 1-inch cubes ; 16  mushroom caps ; 8  metal skewers, or as needed ; 2  green bell peppers, cut into chunks ; 1  red bell pepper, cut into chunks ; 1 large onion, cut into large squares. Whisk the vegetable oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the beef, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Add the mushrooms to the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and reseal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator another 8 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the beef and mushrooms from the marinade, shaking off any excess liquid. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes; set aside for basting. Thread pieces of green bell pepper, beef, red bell pepper, mushroom, and onion onto metal skewers, repeating until all ingredients are skewered. Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently and brushing generously with the reserved marinade until nicely browned on all sides and the meat is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Panna Cotta?",
        "answer": "Panna Cotta is A traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding a good and easy recipe on the internet, so I made up my own recipe. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants. Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on top. This keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.. It requires \u2153 cup skim milk ; 1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups heavy cream ; \u00bd cup white sugar ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons vanilla extract. Pour milk into a small bowl, and stir in the gelatin powder. Set aside. In a saucepan, stir together the heavy cream and sugar, and set over medium heat. Bring to a full boil, watching carefully, as the cream will quickly rise to the top of the pan. Pour the gelatin and milk into the cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook for one minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla and pour into six individual ramekin dishes. Cool the ramekins uncovered at room temperature. When cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight before serving."

        "answer": "Pancake Lasagna for One (or More) is Until now if you wanted lasagna, you had to make a lot, but thanks to this easy technique, that's all changed. This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3 pancakes for later use! The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting like egg noodles. It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade lasagna noodles. Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.. It requires 2 large eggs ; \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt ; 1 teaspoon olive oil ; \u00bd cup cold water ; \u00bd cup all-purpose flour ; 1 tablespoon olive oil ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups full-fat ricotta cheese, well drained ;   kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper ; 1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil ; \u00bd cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups prepared marinara sauce ; 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese ; 1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese ; 1 tablespoon olive oil ; 1 teaspoon finely sliced fresh basil. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set out 4 small, shallow, oven-proof baking dishes or ramekins. Combine eggs, salt, olive oil, water, and flour for pancakes in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until very smooth, then let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Brush oil into a nonstick skillet and set heat to medium. When the skillet is hot, add about 1/4 cup batter and tilt the pan so it evenly coats the bottom. Cook until the batter sets and the top surface goes from looking wet to dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and repeat to make remaining 3 pancakes. Cut each pancake into 3 triangles. Combine ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for filling in a bowl; mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.

        "answer": "Chef John's French Fries is I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be twice fried. The first frying in done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.. It requires 1  russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips ; 1 quart vegetable oil for frying ;   salt to taste. Soak potatoes in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add the potatoes in the hot oil for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Remove potatoes from oil with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towel and to cool completely. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the potatoes again until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Easy Baked Beef Brisket?",
        "answer": "Easy Baked Beef Brisket is For a brisket recipe, this is considered very fast. The convention of cooking it low and slow often results in dried-out meat that never reaches the proper internal temperature. Instead of waiting all day and risking such disappointment, we dial up the temperature slightly and bake it in about half the time to ensure it's both tender and moist. Garnish with chives if desired.. It requires 3 pounds first-cut brisket (or flat-cut), trimmed of fat ; 4 teaspoons kosher salt ; 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper ; \u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper ; 2 tablespoons butter ; 1 large yellow onion, sliced ; 1 teaspoon kosher salt ; 4 cloves garlic, sliced ; 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary ; 1 cup apple juice. Season both sides of the brisket generously with salt, pepper, and cayenne. For best results, place brisket over an aluminum foil \"rack\" set over a plate and refrigerate, uncovered, 8 to 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced by about half, about 3 minutes. Transfer half of the apple-onion mixture into a baking dish. Place brisket fat-side up on top; cover with remaining apple-onion mixture. Cover baking dish tightly with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) and bake until fork-tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes.  Check for doneness after 2 hours. Transfer brisket to a plate and tent with foil. Pour the onions and braising liquid into a large measuring cup or bowl. Skim some fat off the top. Puree with a stick blender to create a gravy. Slice brisket across the grain and serve with the gravy."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Homemade Ricotta Cheese?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Homemade Ricotta Cheese is If I came over to your place and you served me homemade ricotta cheese, I'd think you were pretty cool. And while that's a good reason to do this, there are even better reasons--like, it's super fun to do, ridiculously easy, and you'll end up with something far superior to what you buy in the store. Serve on toast with honey, cayenne, and sea salt or with tomatoes, basil, freshly ground black pepper, olive oil, and sea salt--or however you like.. It requires 4 cups whole milk ; \u00bd cup heavy cream ; 1\u2009\u00bc teaspoons kosher salt ; 2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar. Line a mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a deep bowl or pot. Combine milk, cream, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally in a \"figure eight\" motion, until it reaches a temperature of 195 degrees F (90 degrees C). If you don't have a thermometer, this will be right before it starts to simmer. You'll see steam rising from the surface, and tiny bubbles forming around the edges of the pan. Turn off the heat, pour in the vinegar, and stir slowly in a \"figure eight\" motion for 3 or 4 seconds. Let the mixture sit, untouched, for 6 minutes. Carefully ladle into the cheesecloth-lined mesh strainer so that the dripping whey drains into the pot or bowl. Let the ricotta drain into the pot for between 20 and 45 minutes, depending on how soft or firm you want your cheese. The longer it drains, the firmer the texture will be once chilled. Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and lift the drained ricotta out of the strainer and place in a bowl. Let cool on the counter to room temperature, then wrap and chill thoroughly. Remove cheesecloth and serve. Ricotta usually needs an additional pinch of salt when serving."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Tender Pork Spare Ribs?",
        "answer": "Tender Pork Spare Ribs is I saw a Celebrity Chef use this braising method for baby back ribs, so I decided to give it a try for pork spare ribs. I changed the seasonings and increased the cooking time and I have been very pleased with them every time. They're really tender and the meat is so flavorful that you don't have to add BBQ sauce unless you want to. My neighbor is the one who told me about the fajita seasoning, and she was right on!. It requires 1 cup brown sugar ; \u00bd cup fajita seasoning (such as Fiesta\u00ae) ; 2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika ; 2 racks pork spareribs, fat trimmed ; 1 cup beer ; 3 cloves garlic, minced ; 1 tablespoon honey ; 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce ; 1 tablespoon prepared brown mustard. Mix the brown sugar, fajita seasoning, and paprika in a bowl. Rub both sides of the pork spareribs with the brown sugar mixture. Place the spareribs in a 9x13-inch baking pan; cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Whisk together the beer, garlic, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard in a bowl. Set aside. Tear off 2 large sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil and lay them shiny-side down. Place a rack of spareribs on each sheet, meaty-side up. Tear off 2 more sheets of foil and place them on top of the ribs, shiny-side up. Begin tightly folding the edges of the foil together to create a sealed packet. Just before sealing completely, divide the beer mixture evenly into each packet. Complete the seal. Place the packets side-by-side on an 11x14-inch baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the ribs are very tender, 3 hours and 30 minutes to 4 hours. Carefully open each packet, and drain the drippings into a saucepan. You may only need the drippings from one packet. Set ribs aside. Simmer the drippings over medium-high heat until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Brush the thickened sauce over the ribs. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Place the ribs back into the oven and broil until the sauce is lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Crispy Rolled Breakfast Burrito?",
        "answer": "Crispy Rolled Breakfast Burrito is I've always loved the idea of a breakfast burrito, but I've never been crazy about the execution. It always seemed like we were rolling up a bunch of random breakfast ingredients in a tortilla. Plus, it always bothered me that just a little of the top and bottom got browned, I mean, what about the sides? Here I'm going to show you a technique that takes care of both of those issues and will work no matter what ingredients you decide to use.. It requires 4 slices bacon ; 1 large russet potato, peeled and cubed ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste ; \u00bc cup sliced onion ; \u00bc cup sliced bell pepper ; 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese ; 4 large eggs, beaten ; 2 (10 inch) flour tortillas ; 1 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste ; 1 medium avocado, cubed  ; 2 tablespoons sour cream ; 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, or to taste. Place bacon in a cold, nonstick pan over medium to medium-high heat. Cook until browned, crisp, and foamy, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove to a paper towel-lined plate, and set aside. Place cubed potatoes into the pan of bacon fat and set heat to medium. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Cook, tossing and turning occasionally, until the potatoes are browned, crispy, and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onions and peppers, and cook until they soften up a bit, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer everything into a strainer set over a bowl to drain excess bacon fat. To make one breakfast burrito, place 2 strips cooked bacon back in the pan. Turn heat to medium and scatter 1/2 of the potato mixture in and around. Scatter over 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese as evenly as possible, and then pour  2 beaten eggs over top. Tilt the pan to make sure the egg is evenly distributed. Place a tortilla over the top and press down lightly into the rest of the ingredients. Cook just until the eggs firm up enough to flip, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to carefully, but confidently, flip everything over so the tortilla is now on the bottom. Cook until the tortilla is as browned and crispy as you like, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer onto a plate. Roll into a burrito and serve with hot sauce, avocado, sour cream, and cilantro. Repeat to cook remaining burrito."

A little bit of zip is added using pepper flakes.  Serve this over egg noodles.. It requires 2 (2 pound) beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips ; \u00bd cup red wine ; 1 teaspoon salt ; \u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper ; 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil ; 2 tablespoons butter ; 1 large onion, diced ; 3 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 tablespoons butter ; 1 cup sliced mushrooms ; \u00bc cup butter ; \u00bc cup all-purpose flour ; 1\u2009\u2153 cups beef stock ; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce ; 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard ; 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes ; \u2153 cup sour cream ; 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened. Place the beef into a large bowl. Stir in the red wine, salt, and black pepper. Marinate for 10 minutes, then remove the beef and pat dry with a paper towel. Reserve the remaining marinade. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the beef; cook and stir until browned, then transfer to a plate, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any remaining grease from the skillet. Melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until the onion is soft and translucent. Transfer the onion mixture to the plate with the prepared beef; set aside. Melt another 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet over medium heat, and stir in the mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes. Place the cooked mushrooms in a bowl and set aside. Melt 1/4 cup of butter in the skillet. Whisk in the flour, cook and stir until the flour no longer tastes raw, about 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in the beef stock. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium low.

        "answer": "How to Make Coquilles Saint-Jacques is For something fancy, this is pretty easy to make. It's one of the world's most delicious dishes. It's rich and decadent, and yet still light.. It requires 2 tablespoons unsalted butter ; \u00bd cup diced shallots ; \u00bd pound white button mushrooms, sliced ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 1 cup white wine ; 1 pound sea scallops ; \u00bd cup heavy whipping cream ; 1  egg yolk ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste ; 2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon ; 1 teaspoon lemon zest ;   4 large oven-safe scallop shells ; \u00bc cup shredded Gruyere cheese ; 1 pinch paprika ; 8  fresh tarragon leaves. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; saute shallots in the hot butter until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir mushrooms, salt, and black pepper into shallots. Turn heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Pour white wine over mushroom mixture, dissolving any browned bits of food on bottom of skillet into wine; bring to a simmer. Gently place scallops into wine and poach in the mushroom mixture until barely firm, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a bowl. Strain mushroom mixture into another bowl, reserving mushrooms and cooking liquid separately. Return strained liquid to skillet, pour in any accumulated juices from scallops, and stir in cream. Bring to a boil and cook until cream sauce is reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Turn off heat and let mixture cool for 1 minute. Quickly whisk egg yolk into cream sauce until combined. Transfer skillet to a work surface (such as a heatproof countertop or cutting board) and stir cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons tarragon, and lemon zest into sauce. Divide mushroom mixture into scallop shells, spreading mushrooms out to cover bottoms of shells; place about 3 scallops onto each portion. Spoon cream sauce over scallops to coat; let sauce drizzle down into mushrooms. Sprinkle lightly with Gruyere cheese and paprika or cayenne. Turn oven's broiler to high. Slightly crinkle a large sheet of aluminum foil and place onto a baking sheet. Place filled shells onto foil and press lightly to help them stay level. Broil about 10 inches from the heat source until sauce is bubbling and cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to serving plates lined with napkins to prevent shells from tipping; garnish each portion with 2 crossed tarragon leaves."

It requires 2 cups white sugar ; 1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O\u00ae ; 1 cup butter, softened ; 4  eggs (room temperature) ; 2\u2009\u00be cups sifted cake flour ; 2\u2009\u00bd teaspoons baking powder ; 1 cup whole milk, room temperature ; 1 tablespoon vanilla extract ; \u00bd cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and dry strawberry gelatin until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the batter alternately with the milk. Blend in vanilla and strawberry puree. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a small knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool in their pans over a wire rack for at least 10 minutes, before tapping out to cool completely."

Sprinkle shanks with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook shanks until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer shanks to plate. Add onions, carrots and garlic to pot and saute until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine, tomatoes, chicken broth and beef broth. Season with rosemary and thyme.

Drain, and rinse, then refill the bowl with water, and add the salt. Let the potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes. Drain, then rinse and drain again. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).  Fry potato slices in small batches. Once they start turning golden, remove and drain on paper towels.

This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. Tastes great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! Enjoy with fresh squeezed lemon juice.. It requires 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired ; 6  chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied) ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; \u00be cup all-purpose flour ; 1 tablespoon paprika ; 2  eggs, beaten ; 2 cups seasoned bread crumbs ; 1  large lemon, zested. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven. Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more.

It is so easy to prepare and cook. There are other versions that can be cooked on the grill but we prefer ours in the oven. It's a dinner our whole family loves.. It requires \u00bc cup garlic powder ; 2 tablespoons seasoned salt ; 2 tablespoons onion powder ; 1 tablespoon dried oregano ; 1 tablespoon salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons ground black pepper ; 1 (12 fluid ounce) can light-flavored beer (such as Bud Light\u00ae) ; 1 (3 pound) whole chicken ; 4  green onions, sliced ; 4  green onions, cut in half crosswise ; 1 (12 fluid ounce) can light-flavored beer (such as Bud Light\u00ae). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the garlic powder, seasoned salt, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, and ground black pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Pour 1/3 of one can of beer into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the open beer can in the center of the baking dish. Rinse chicken under cold running water. Discard giblets and neck from chicken; drain and pat dry. Fit whole chicken over the open beer can with the legs on the bottom. With the breast of the chicken facing you, use a paring knife to cut a small slit on each side and press the tip of each wing into the slit to encourage even cooking. Rub the prepared seasoning mixture to taste over the entire chicken. Pat the sliced green onions around the whole chicken evenly. Some will fall into the beer, that's fine. Press the halved green onions into the top cavity of the chicken. Open the remaining beer and pour 1/2 of it into the pan under then chicken. Reserve the remaining beer. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven. After 45 minutes, pour remaining beer into the pan under the chicken. Continue baking until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 additional minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven and discard the beer can. Cover the chicken with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing."

It requires 4 teaspoons garlic powder ; 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 4 sprigs fresh rosemary ; 4 thick slices bacon. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon garlic powder on a chicken breast and season with salt and pepper. Lay one rosemary sprig on the chicken breast. Wrap the bacon around the chicken to hold the rosemary on. Secure the bacon with a toothpick or an additional thick rosemary stem. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stay near the grill to combat any flare ups from the bacon.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Panzanella?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Panzanella is The key to this panzanella is frying the bread cubes in loads of olive oil in a skillet, which obviously makes them crispy. But the healthful fat also soaks into the bread cubes and renders them semi-waterproof, or dressing-proof. The same goes for the dusting of Parmesan cheese applied halfway through the crisping process.. It requires 2 cups 1/2-inch stale bread cubes, or more to taste ; \u00bc cup olive oil, or to taste ; \u00bc cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste ; 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved ; 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or more to taste ; 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste ; \u00bd teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste ; 1 pinch white sugar ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 4 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced, or more to taste. Pour bread into a large skillet and drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil, working in batches if necessary. Cook and stir bread over medium heat, adding more oil as needed, until bread cubes are golden and crispy on the outside, 7 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top of the bread cubes; cook and stir until cheese is melted onto bread, and bread is crispy on the outside but still chewy on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes more. Cool completely. Combine tomatoes, red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until well-mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Toss basil into tomato mixture; add bread cubes and stir. Let salad sit at room temperature 3 to 4 minutes; if the liquid is completely absorbed, add more vinegar and extra virgin olive oil to taste. Season with salt and black pepper."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Church Supper Macaroni and Cheese?",
        "answer": "Church Supper Macaroni and Cheese is It seems like there are endless recipe variations on macaroni and cheese; however my family is not a big fan of cheese sauce-based macaroni and cheese. It seems to dilute the cheese flavor. This simple but tasty recipe was given to me at a church supper in Terre Haute; it's old, definitely has German or Jewish (kugel?) roots. The secret is to use a good-quality EXTRA-SHARP Cheddar cheese.. It requires 2 tablespoons salt ; 2 cups elbow macaroni ; \u00bc cup butter, softened  (Optional); 2  large eggs ; 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk ; \u00bd (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk ; 1\u2009\u00bd pounds extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded ; 1 pinch paprika, or to taste ; \u00bc cup butter  (Optional); \u00bd cup soft bread crumbs  (Optional). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole with butter. Dissolve salt in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil and cook macaroni, stirring often, until pasta is tender but still slightly firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse macaroni under cool water, drain, and transfer to a bowl. Stir 1/4 cup softened butter into macaroni and toss a few times to melt butter and coat macaroni. Beat eggs in a bowl; whisk evaporated and condensed milks into eggs. Spread a layer of macaroni into the bottom of the prepared casserole; sprinkle with a layer of Cheddar cheese. Continue layering macaroni and cheese, ending with a layer of cheese on top. Pour egg-milk mixture over the layers. Use a fork to gently dig into the layers, assuring that the egg-milk mixture flows into all the layers. Sprinkle with paprika. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet over medium heat; cook bread crumbs in the hot butter, stirring constantly,  until fragrant and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle crumb topping over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes."

        "answer": "Best Ever Jalapeno Poppers is This is a recipe I made by taking the best of three or four popper recipes and combining them to make something that tastes wonderful. A frequent request at my house, and at others.  I usually make 100 and put them in the fridge.  They don't last long. Adjust the amount of bacon bits and type of shredded cheese to taste. Increase the recipe as necessary!  Lots of tests helps to best figure out the way you like it. Be sure to wear rubber gloves while seeding the jalapenos -- they will burn.. It requires 12 ounces cream cheese, softened ; 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese ; 1 tablespoon bacon bits ; 12 ounces jalapeno peppers, seeded and halved ; 1 cup milk ; 1 cup all-purpose flour ; 1 cup dry bread crumbs ; 2 quarts oil for frying. In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese and bacon bits. Spoon this mixture into the jalapeno pepper halves. Put the milk and flour into two separate small bowls. Dip the stuffed jalapenos first into the milk then into the flour, making sure they are well coated with each. Allow the coated jalapenos to dry for about 10 minutes. Dip the jalapenos in milk again and roll them through the breadcrumbs. Allow them to dry, then repeat to ensure  the entire surface of the jalapeno is coated. In a medium skillet, heat the oil to 365 degrees F ( 180 degrees C). Deep fry the coated jalapenos 2 to 3 minutes each, until golden brown. Remove and let drain on a paper towel."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Russian Honey Cake?",
        "answer": "Russian Honey Cake is There are 3 different ways to make this cake\u2026the hard way, the harder way, and the way we're gonna do it--the hardest way. Because it's that worth it. The tiny amount of bitterness we get from the burnt honey really is the secret here, and the slightly tangy whipped cream frosting provides a bit of acidity and lovely light texture; and unlike other frostings, it's not too sweet.. It requires \u00be cup wildflower honey ; 3 tablespoons cold water ; 14 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into slices ; 1 cup white sugar ; \u00be cup wildflower honey ; 6 large cold eggs ; 2\u2009\u00bd teaspoons baking soda ; \u00be teaspoon fine salt ; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ; 3\u2009\u00be cups all-purpose flour ; 4 cups cold heavy whipping cream ; \u00be cup sour cream. Pour honey into a deep saucepan over medium heat. Boil until a shade darker and caramel-like in aroma, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and whisk in cold water. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as Silpat\u00ae). Place a mixing bowl and a whisk in the refrigerator. Place a large metal bowl over the lowest heat setting on the stovetop. Add butter, sugar, 1/4 cup of the burnt honey, and regular wildflower honey. Let sit until butter melts, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, combine baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk butter mixture and let sit until very warm to the touch. Whisk in eggs. Keep mixture over low heat until it gets very warm again; whisk in baking soda mixture. Remove from heat. Sift in flour in 2 or 3 additions, stirring well after each, until batter is easily spreadable. Transfer about 1/2 cup batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread into an 8- or 9-inch circle using an offset spatula. Shake and tap the pan to knock out any air bubbles. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove liner from the pan and let cake layer continue cooling until firm enough to remove, 6 to 7 minutes. Invert cake onto a round of parchment paper. Repeat until you have a total of 8 cake layers, letting each cool on an individual parchment round. Trim edges using a pizza wheel to ensure they are the same size; save scraps for crumb mixture. Spread remaining batter onto the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are dry, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut into small pieces; toss with reserved cake scraps. Return to the oven and continue to bake until browned, 7 to 10 minutes more. Let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a resealable bag and beat into fairly fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Set aside. Remove the bowl and whisk from the refrigerator. Pour in heavy cream. Whisk until soft peaks form. Add remaining burnt honey and sour cream; continue whisking until stiff peaks form. Place a cake layer on a parchment paper round on top of a pizza pan or serving plate. Spread a cup of frosting evenly on top, almost to the edge. Repeat with cake layers and frosting, pressing the layers in smooth-side down. Place last cake layer smooth-side up. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Cover with crumbs; clean any excess crumbs around base. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 8 hours, to overnight. Transfer to a cake stand using 2 spatulas. Cut and serve."

(I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.).

Cook celery and onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat.

        "answer": "Chocolate-Cherry Scones is These scones are made with Amarena cherries, which refers to a variety of dark wild cherry from the Bologna and Modena regions of Italy. They are typically sold preserved in a sweet syrup. They have an intense sweet cherry flavor, and pair perfectly with chocolate.. It requires 2 cups all-purpose flour ; \u2153 cup white sugar ; 2 teaspoons baking powder ; \u00bc teaspoon baking soda ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; \u00bd cup cold butter, cubed ; 1 cup Amarena cherries in syrup, drained and halved (syrup reserved) ; \u00bc cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips ; \u00bd cup heavy cream ; 1 large egg ; 1 tablespoon heavy cream ; \u00bc cup powdered sugar ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons milk. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 3 or 4 times to mix. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, 20 to 25 times. Pour mixture into a large bowl. Fold in cherries and chocolate chips, making sure they are well coated with the dry ingredients. Mix together 1/2 cup heavy cream, egg, and 1 tablespoon cherry syrup together with a fork in a small bowl until well combined. Stir into flour mixture and mix just until slightly moistened. Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Gather dough in a circle using floured hands, kneading only slightly to incorporate any remaining dry ingredients. Flatten dough into a 9-inch round disc; cut disc into 8 triangles. Transfer scones using a bench scraper onto the prepared baking sheets (4 scones per baking sheet).

        "answer": "Crispy Fried Chicken is I experimented for many years before developing this recipe. It's bits and pieces of hints I had heard over the years. I have had many compliments on this chicken. Most of this recipe is dependant on your own taste. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!. It requires 1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces ; 1 cup buttermilk ; 2 cups all-purpose flour for coating ; 1 teaspoon paprika ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying. Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken). Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well. Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL! Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot. Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides. When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again and continue to fry until crispy. Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest."

Prepare the onion:  cut approximately  3/4 to 1 inch off of the top and bottom of the onion, remove skin.  Remove the 1-inch diameter core from the middle of the onion.  Using a large, sharp knife, slice down the center of the onion about 3/4 of the way down, turn 90 degrees and slice again.  Keep slicing the sections in half, being careful not to cut to the bottom, until you have 16 sections.  Spread the petals apart to make coating easier. Dip the onion in the milk, then coat well with the flour mixture.  Separate the petals again and sprinkle the flour mixture between them.  Once you have coated all of the petals well, dip it into the milk and into the flour mixture again.  Place in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes while you preheat the oil. Pour enough oil to cover the onion into a deep fryer or deep pot. Preheat the oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the onion right side up in the oil for 10 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from oil and let drain in a rack or paper towels.  Open the center of the onion wide so that you can put the small bowl of dipping sauce in the center."

Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir sausage into onions; cook and stir until sausage is broken up and browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour 1 1/2 cups chicken broth into sausage mixture and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce?",
        "answer": "Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce is A classic curry-stand recipe. This is not haute cuisine; this is the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala that you crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2 a.m. I make vast quantities of the sauce at one time, and it freezes very well. I also added much more cayenne pepper than 1 teaspoon, but I give out the recipe like this for people who don't like heat.. It requires 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) ; 1  onion, finely chopped ; 4 cloves garlic, minced ; 1 tablespoon ground cumin ; 1 teaspoon salt  (Optional); 1 teaspoon ground ginger ; 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper ; \u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon ; \u00bc teaspoon ground turmeric ; 1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce ; 1 cup heavy whipping cream ; 2 teaspoons paprika ; 1 tablespoon white sugar  (Optional); 1 tablespoon vegetable oil ; 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces ; \u00bd teaspoon curry powder ; \u00bd teaspoon salt, or to taste  (Optional); 1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste  (Optional). Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into the onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir tomato sauce into the onion and spice mixture, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, paprika, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. Transfer chicken and any pan juices into the sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste."

Fold the narrower end of each chicken breast up over the butter to form a tight pocket around the butter. Gather the sides of each chicken breast to the center to form a round ball. The top of the chicken will be smooth and the bottom will be gathered. Tightly wrap each chicken breast ball in plastic wrap, put wrapped breasts on a plate, and chill in the freezer until the gathered bottoms hold together and are slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Whisk flour and 2 teaspoons salt together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs together in another shallow bowl. Pour panko bread crumbs into another bowl. Remove chicken breast balls from plastic wrap. Gently press each chicken breast ball into flour mixture to coat and shake off any excess flour. Dip into beaten eggs, then press into bread crumbs. Place breaded chicken onto a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer to chill until firm, about 15 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Working in batches, cook chicken, gathered-side down, in hot oil and until lightly golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle salt and cayenne pepper over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until you can hear the butter start to sizzle on the baking sheet, 15 to 17 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes before serving."

        "answer": "Homemade Pickled Ginger (Gari) is Pickled ginger is called gari or amazu shoga in Japanese. It's served with sushi or sashimi and eaten between different kinds of sushi. It helps to clean your taste buds and enhance the flavors. It's also great with Century Eggs - a Chinese delicacy. You can find prepared pickled ginger in pink or white at most Asian markets but I preferred to make my own and share with family and friends.. It requires 8 ounces fresh young ginger root, peeled ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons sea salt ; 1 cup rice vinegar ; \u2153 cup white sugar. Cut the ginger into chunks and place them into a bowl. Sprinkle with sea salt, stir to coat and let stand for about 30 minutes. Transfer the ginger to a clean jar. In a saucepan, stir together the rice vinegar and sugar until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil, then pour the boiling liquid over the ginger root pieces in the jar. Allow the mixture to cool, then put the lid on the jar and store in the refrigerator for at least one week. You will see that the liquid will change to slightly pinkish in few minutes. Don't be alarmed because it's the reaction of rice vinegar that causes the change. Only quality rice vinegar can do that! Some commercial pickled ginger has red coloring added. Cut pieces of ginger into paper thin slices for serving."

Born in Nekkar am Rhein in the 1904, she naturally learned to cook traditional German meals as a young woman and didn't rely on a cookbook. I try to capture the nuance in this. Serve with potato dumplings.. It requires 3 pounds beef rump roast ; 2 large onions, chopped ; 1 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste ; 1 cup water ; 1 tablespoon salt ; 1 tablespoon ground black pepper ; 1 tablespoon white sugar ; 10  whole cloves, or more to taste ; 2  bay leaves, or more to taste ; 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil ; 10  gingersnap cookies, crumbled. Place beef rump roast, onions, vinegar, water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, sugar, cloves, and bay leaves in a large pot. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning meat daily. Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels, reserving marinade. Season flour to taste with salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture over beef. Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat; cook beef until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Pour reserved marinade over beef, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until beef is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Remove beef to a platter and slice. Strain solids from remaining liquid and continue cooking over medium heat.

        "answer": "Easy Pavlova is In this elegant dessert, a crisp white meringue layer is filled with whipped cream and fresh fruit. To keep your meringue from being flat and grainy, try beating egg whites until stiff but not dry. Overbeaten egg whites lose volume and deflate when folded into other ingredients. Also, when beating in sugar, beat in about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well between each addition. Then beat until meringue is thick, white and glossy. Be absolutely sure not a particle of grease or egg yolk gets into the whites.. It requires 4  egg whites ; 1\u2009\u00bc cups white sugar ; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ; 1 teaspoon lemon juice ; 2 teaspoons cornstarch ; 1 pint heavy cream ; 6  kiwi, peeled and sliced. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 9-inch circle on the parchment paper. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add in the sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat until thick and glossy. Gently fold in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Spoon mixture inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper. Working from the center, spread mixture toward the outside edge, building edge slightly. This should leave a slight depression in the center. Bake for 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack. In a small bowl, beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form; set aside. Remove the paper, and place meringue on a flat serving plate. Fill the center of the meringue with whipped cream, and top with kiwifruit slices."

It requires 1 medium potato, peeled and cubed ; \u00bd pound ground beef ; \u00bd pound ground pork ; \u2153 clove garlic, chopped ; \u00bd cup chopped onion ; \u00bc cup water ; \u00bd teaspoon mustard powder ; \u00bd teaspoon dried thyme ; \u00bc teaspoon ground cloves ; 1 teaspoon salt ; \u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u00bc teaspoon dried sage ; 1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, mash, and set aside. Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef and pork into a large saucepan, and add the garlic, onion and water. Season with mustard powder, thyme, cloves and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring to crumble the meat and mix in the spices, until the meat is evenly browned. Remove from the heat, and mix in the mashed potato. Place one of the pie crusts into a 9 inch pie plate. Fill with the meat mixture, then top with the other pie crust. Prick the top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. Crimp around the edges using the tines of the fork, and remove any excess dough. Cover the edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the crust has browned. Serve by itself, or with a beef gravy."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce?",
        "answer": "Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce is This batter-fried onion and a spicy dipping sauce will get your party going any day!. It requires \u00bd cup mayonnaise ; 1 tablespoon ketchup ; 2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish sauce ; \u2153 teaspoon paprika ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; \u215b teaspoon dried oregano ; 1 pinch ground black pepper ; \u2153 teaspoon cayenne pepper ; 1  egg ; 1 cup milk ; 1 cup all-purpose flour ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons cayenne pepper ; 1 teaspoon paprika ; \u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u2153 teaspoon dried oregano ; \u215b teaspoon dried thyme ; \u215b teaspoon ground cumin ; 1 large sweet onion ; \u00be cup vegetable oil for frying. To make sauce: In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish, 1/3 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon oregano, a dash ground black pepper and cayenne pepper; mix well. Keep sauce covered in refrigerator until needed. To make the batter: In a medium bowl, beat egg and add milk. In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, ground black pepper, oregano, thyme and cumin; mix. To slice onion: slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of the onion and remove the papery skin. Use a thin knife to cut a 1 inch diameter core out of the middle of the onion. Now use a very sharp, large knife to slice the onion several times down the center to create 'petals':  First slice through the center of the onion to about three-fourths of the way down. Turn the onion 90 degrees and slice it again in an X across the first slice. Keep slicing the sections in half, very carefully until the onion has been cut 16 times. Do not cut down to the bottom of the onion. (The last 8 slices will be difficult, be careful). Spread the 'petals' of the onion apart. To help keep them separate you could plunge the onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water. Dip the onion into the milk mixture and then coat it liberally with the flour mixture. Again separate the petals and sprinkle the dry coating between them.  Once you're sure the onion is well-coated, dip it back into the wet mixture and into the dry coating again.  This double-dipping ensures you have a well-coated onion because some of the coating will wash off when you fry the onion. Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries. Fry the onion right side up in the oil for 10 minutes or until it turns brown. When the onion has browned, remove it from the oil and let it drain on a rack or paper towels. Open the onion wider from the center so that you can put a small dish of the dipping sauce in the center."

Mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin together in a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside. 3. Prepare onion: Slice 1 inch off of the top and bottom of onion and remove the papery skin. Remove a 1-inch diameter core from middle of onion, leaving the very bottom of the root end intact. Use a large, sharp knife to slice down center of onion about 3/4 of the way down; turn onion 90 degrees and slice again. Keep slicing each section in half until you have 16 sections, being careful not to cut through bottom of onion. 4. Spread \"petals\" apart. (To help keep them separate, you could plunge onion into boiling water for 1 minute and then into cold water to stop the cooking.) 5. Dip onion into milk mixture and then coat well with seasoned flour mixture, separating the petals and sprinkling the flour mixture between them. Dip onion back into milk mixture, then coat with flour mixture again to ensure all pieces are well coated. 6. Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries. 7. Lower onion, cut-side up, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a rack or on paper towels. 8. Open center of onion wide enough to fit the bowl of dipping sauce and serve."

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute.

Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Crumble bacon over the top just before serving."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chocolate-Covered Raspberry Brownies?",
        "answer": "Chocolate-Covered Raspberry Brownies is These intensely rich brownie bars are not for the faint of appetite. Each brownie bears a fruity layer of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries that's covered with a truffle-like blanket of chocolate ganache over top. In other words, they're decadence incarnate. If raspberries aren't your favorite, you can always substitute strawberry jam and fresh strawberries--but you'll want to slice them in half rather than leaving them whole. If desired, garnish with a drizzle of melted white chocolate.. It requires \u00bd cup unsalted butter ; \u00bd cup semisweet chocolate chips ; \u00be cup all-purpose flour ; \u2153 cup unsweetened cocoa powder ; \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt ; \u00bd teaspoon baking powder ; 1 cup white sugar ; 2 large eggs ; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ; \u00bd cup raspberry jam ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups fresh raspberries ; 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips ; 1 cup heavy cream ; 2 tablespoons unsalted butter ; 1 pinch kosher salt. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan and line the bottom and sides with parchment paper, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Lightly grease parchment. Make the brownies: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; once melted, stir in the chocolate chips. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and mixture is smooth; set aside and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Combine sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy. Mix in vanilla. Mix in the cooled, melted chocolate, adding it to the bowl in a slow, steady stream. Mix in the dry ingredients in increments, at low speed, until just combined. Finish incorporating the batter by hand with a rubber spatula if necessary. Scrape the batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until brownies begin to pull away from the sides of pan and a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies tests clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Place the pan on a wire rack and allow brownies to cool completely, 30 to 40 minutes. To prepare the topping, spread the raspberry jam evenly over the brownies in the pan, spreading right to the edge. Arrange the whole raspberries in a single layer over the jam. Place the chocolate chips in a medium, heat-proof mixing bowl. Warm heavy cream and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. When the butter melts and the cream begins steaming and bubbling at the edges, pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes to allow chocolate to melt; add salt and whisk until completely smooth. Pour the chocolate ganache over the raspberries. Refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Carefully pull the brownies from the pan using parchment paper overhang; place on a cutting board and carefully peel the parchment paper from the sides. Slice into 9 squares and serve."

Heat 4 cups vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg in a mixing bowl. Add the chicken cubes; sprinkle with salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and white pepper; mix well. Mix in 1 cup of cornstarch a little bit at a time until the chicken cubes are well coated. In batches, carefully drop the chicken cubes into the hot oil one by one, cooking until they turns golden brown and begin to float, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken and allow to cool as you fry the next batch. Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Cook until the chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir a minute or two until the garlic has turned golden and the chiles brighten. Add 1/2 cup sugar, the ginger, chicken broth, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and peanut oil; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Dissolve 2 teaspoons of cornstarch into the water, and stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute. Stir the chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook for a few minutes until the chicken absorbs some of the sauce."

        "answer": "Easy Naan is Using your broiler is a great way to make naan. This naan recipe is deceptively easy! You can choose to make garlic naan or plain naan. Enjoy with your favorite curry!. It requires 1 cup warm water ; 2\u2009\u00bd teaspoons active dry yeast ; 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste ; 3 tablespoons milk ; 1  egg, beaten ; 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste ; 5\u2009\u00bd cups bread flour, or as needed ; 2 cloves garlic, minced  (Optional); \u00bc cup butter, melted. Combine water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until bubbly and frothy, about 10 minutes. Stir in milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough into a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and knead well. For garlic naan, knead in garlic at this point. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of golf balls. Roll into balls, cover with a clean cloth, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Roll out 2 balls of dough into elongated ovals. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and cook under the broiler until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Brush butter on both sides and flip. Continue broiling until the second side is firm and golden, 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough."

I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that's gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.. It requires 8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti ; 1 tablespoon vegetable oil ; 1 pound bay scallops ; 2 tablespoons butter ; 3 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest ; 1 pinch red pepper flakes ; \u2153 cup dry sherry ; 1 cup heavy cream ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 1  lemon, juiced ; 2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided ;   Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for 60 seconds. Toss to turn. Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic. Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute. Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add half the parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Grate generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls."

Introduced in April of 1997, this glaze has become one of Friday's best-selling items. This versatile sweet-and-slightly-spicy sauce can be ordered on salmon, baby back ribs, steak, chicken, pork chops...even on chicken wings.. It requires 1 head garlic ; 1 tablespoon olive oil ; 1\u2009\u2153 cups dark brown sugar ; 1 cup pineapple juice ; \u2154 cup water ; \u00bc cup teriyaki sauce ; 1 tablespoon soy sauce ; 3 tablespoons lemon juice ; 3 tablespoons minced white onion ; 1 tablespoon bourbon whiskey ; 1 tablespoon crushed pineapple ; \u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cut about 1/2-inch from the top of the garlic head. Trim the roots so the garlic sits flat. Remove some of the outer layers of papery skin from the garlic, leaving enough so that the cloves stay together. Put garlic into a small casserole dish or baking dish, drizzle olive oil over it, and cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Roast garlic in preheated oven until the cloves are soft, about 1 hour. Stir brown sugar, pineapple juice, water, teriyaki sauce, and soy sauce together in a saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and keep at simmer. Squeeze sides of the garlic until the pasty roasted garlic emerges. Measure 2 teaspoons roasted garlic into the saucepan and incorporate into the sauce with a whisk. Reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use. Stir lemon juice, white onion, bourbon whiskey, pineapple, and cayenne pepper into the sauce; bring to a simmer and cook until the volume of the liquid reduces by half and is thick and syrup-like, 40 to 50 minutes."

        "answer": "Chef John's Cuban Bread is I didn't think I liked Cuban sandwiches until I had one on real Cuban bread--what a difference! This bread uses lard and a double-hit of yeast plus a fermented starter. All this adds extra flavor and lift.. It requires \u00bd teaspoon active dry yeast ; \u00bd cup warm water ; \u00bd cup flour ; 1 package active dry yeast ; 2 teaspoons white sugar ; \u00be cup warm water ; 3 tablespoons lard ; 2 teaspoons fine salt ; 3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed - divided ; 1 tablespoon cornmeal ;   Water to spray tops of loaves. Combine 1/2 cup warm water, 1/2 teaspoon yeast, and 1/2 cup flour in a bowl or measuring cup. Whisk the starter until well blended. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Place 1 package active dry yeast and 2 teaspoons sugar in a mixing bowl. Pour in 3/4 cup warm water. Let rest 15 minutes to ensure yeast is alive (bubbles will form on surface). Add lard and salt to bowl; add 1 cup of the flour. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated and dough forms a sticky ball. Add the starter (reserving 1/4 cup if you want to keep the starter going, if desired. Otherwise add it all.). Sprinkle most of the rest of the flour on the dough, reserving 1/2 cup to be used if needed when kneading. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough comes together in a firm ball, adding additional flour only as needed. Dough should be soft and supple with just a bit of tackiness on the surface. Place dough in a bowl and coat surface with a little vegetable oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm spot to rise. Let rise until at least doubled in size, about 2 hours. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle with a little cornmeal. Transfer dough onto lightly floured surface. Lightly press the dough into a rectangle with your lightly floured hands. Divide dough in half and press and shape each half into a long 1/2-inch thick rectangle about 12 inches long. Roll up tightly starting at the long end to form a skinny loaf. Flatten a bit. Transfer each loaf to a prepared baking sheet and dust with a bit of flour. Cover with a light, dry towel and let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut a 1/4-inch deep slit down the top of the loaves with a sharp knife or razor. Mist loaves lightly with water. Place pans in pre-heated oven, one pan on lower rack, one on higher rack. After 10 minutes, switch pan positions. Continue to bake until loaves are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer loaves to cooling rack and let cool to room temperature before slicing."

Ideally, you'd use buttercream frosting to ice cupcakes, but I tried these with Lemon Cream Icing for a less buttery icing, and they were perfect! These cupcakes are truly lighter than air and will melt in your mouth.. It requires 3 cups self-rising flour ; \u00bd teaspoon salt ; 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature ; 2 cups white sugar ; 4  eggs, at room temperature ; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ; 2 tablespoons lemon zest ; 1 cup whole milk, divided ; 2\u2009\u00bd tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided ; 2 cups chilled heavy cream ; \u00be cup confectioners' sugar ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons fresh lemon juice. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners. Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each egg until incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest. Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture, one third at a time, alternating with half the milk and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not over mix. Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes.

To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream begins to thicken. Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to High, and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes. Spread on the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers."

        "answer": "Chicken Piccata Casserole is I love chicken piccata, but I don't love cooking it on top of the stove. Get the great piquant taste of chicken piccata, without the spatters, in the oven! It's more convenient, and it frees you up to tend to the other parts of dinner, like some tasty pasta, and maybe a vegetable or a salad.. It requires cooking spray ; 2 tablespoons unsalted butter ; 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; \u00bd cup chicken broth ; \u00bd cup half-and-half ; \u00be cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided ; \u00bc cup lemon juice ; \u00bc cup capers, drained ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves ; 1 medium lemon, sliced ; 3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs ; 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in flour and garlic; stir constantly until garlic is fragrant and flour is mixed well, about 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and half-and-half. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until sauce is bubbly and thick, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, capers, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into 2 cutlets. Place in a single layer in the prepared dish. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the sauce evenly over the chicken and top with lemon slices. Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve warm."

By using a flavorful, yogurt-based marinade, like the one seen herein, even inexperienced grillers can produce impressive results. I'm not sure how 'Turkish' this is--it's loosely based on a lamb marinade I've used for a long time.. It requires 1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt ; 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 2 tablespoons ketchup ; 6 cloves garlic, minced ; 1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes ; 1 tablespoon kosher salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons ground cumin ; 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 teaspoon paprika ; \u215b teaspoon ground cinnamon ; 2\u2009\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved ; 4  long metal skewers. Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, ketchup, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 8 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick \"log\" shape. Place kebabs on grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side 3 or 4 minutes; turn. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."

It requires 12  whole wheat lasagna noodles ; 1 pound lean ground beef ; 2 cloves garlic, chopped ; \u00bd teaspoon garlic powder ; 1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese ; 2  eggs ; \u00bd cup shredded Parmesan cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd (25 ounce) jars tomato-basil pasta sauce ; 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese.

Once the water is boiling, add the lasagna noodles a few at a time, and return to a boil.

Place the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat, add the garlic, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Cook the meat, chopping it into small chunks as it cooks, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.

      {
        "question": "What is the recipe for Lemon Blueberry Pavlova?",
        "answer": "Lemon Blueberry Pavlova is My favorite way to enjoy lemon meringue is with pavlova. The meringue base cools and dries out slowly, creating a crispy, crunchy crust on the outside which contrasts beautifully with a soft, sticky center. Topped with an intense lemon curd filling, fresh blueberries, and a homemade blueberry sauce, this dessert takes a little bit of time to make but is also simple and easy to pull off!. It requires \u00bd cup unsalted butter ; 4 large eggs ; 2 tablespoons lemon zest ; 1 pinch salt ; \u00bd cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup lemon juice ;   cooking spray ; 1 tablespoon cornstarch ; 1 cup white sugar ; 1 pinch cream of tartar ; 2 teaspoons lemon juice ; \u00bc teaspoon pure vanilla extract ; 1 cup blueberries ; 2 tablespoons white sugar ; \u00bd cup cold water ; \u00bd cup fresh blueberries, or more to taste ; 1 sprig fresh mint. Prepare lemon curd filling: Cut butter into small pieces and set aside. Separate eggs, placing yolks in a heat-proof bowl and whites in glass, metal, or ceramic bowl. Cover egg whites and leave on the counter to come to room temperature for the meringue. Add lemon zest, salt, sugar, and lemon juice to egg yolks. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Add 1 to 2 inches water to a saucepan over low heat; bring to a simmer. Place bowl of filling over the simmering water. Cook, stirring constantly with a spatula, until mixture is very hot to the touch and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 3 or 4 pieces at a time, waiting until butter has melted before each addition. Remove from the heat and pour filling into a bowl to cool, about 15 minutes. Lay plastic wrap on top of the filling, pressing down so it doesn't develop a skin, and place in the refrigerator until well chilled, 2 to 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner, such as Silpat\u00ae. Lightly spray with cooking spray. Begin meringue: Mix cornstarch into sugar and set aside. Add cream of tartar, lemon juice, and vanilla to the reserved egg whites. Whisk with a large whisk until very soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Whisk in sugar mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking about 1 minute between each addition, until incorporated. When all sugar mixture has been added, continue to whisk until relatively stiff peaks form and whites are firm enough to hold their shape. Use 2 spoons or a piping bag to transfer whites onto the prepared baking sheet, forming a ring of dollops about 8 or 9 inches across. Fill in the middle with meringue, then go back around the edges adding more meringue to build up the outside edge. Bake in the center of the preheated oven for exactly 1 hour. At 1 hour, turn off the oven and crack the door. Let meringue sit in the oven until its cooled completely, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare blueberry sauce: combine 1 cup blueberries, sugar, and water in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until blueberries collapse and liquid thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pass through a fine mesh strainer. Place in the refrigerator until fully chilled, about 45 minutes. Very carefully transfer cooled meringue to a serving platter using 2 large spatulas if necessary; you may get some cracks but that's okay. Use a spoon to crack the center a bit to make room for the filling. Fill the center with chilled lemon curd filling. Place remaining blueberries over top and drizzle with blueberry sauce. Garnish with mint."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings?",
        "answer": "Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings is The honey-sriracha glaze is quite delicious and incredibly simple, but merely an afterthought here. The real star of the show is the strange, but effective, technique of coating the wings with a baking powder-laced spice rub before baking. Through the magic of chemical reactions, the surface of the chicken becomes bone-dry, and eventually crisps up to something very similar to what would come out of a deep fryer.. It requires 2 tablespoons baking powder ; 1 tablespoon kosher salt ; 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 teaspoon smoked paprika ; 2\u2009\u00bd pounds chicken wing sections ; \u2153 cup honey ; \u2153 cup sriracha sauce ; 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar ; \u00bc teaspoon sesame oil ; 1 pinch sesame seeds, or as desired. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place an oven-proof wire rack over the foil. Whisk baking powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika together in a small bowl. Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the baking powder mixture over wings and toss to coat. Sprinkle remaining baking powder mixture over wings and toss to coat again. Place wings onto the rack of the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn wings and continue baking for 20 minutes. Turn wings again and bake until wings are browned and crispy, about 15 minutes more. Transfer wings to a large bowl. Whisk honey, sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil together in a bowl until glaze is smooth. Drizzle glaze over wings and toss to coat completely.

This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year around.. It requires 1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket ; 1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet\u00ae), or as desired ; 1 tablespoon vegetable oil ; 1  onion, sliced ; 6 cloves garlic, sliced ; 2 tablespoons water. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours."

        "answer": "Blueberry Maple Scones is This blueberry scone recipe uses a tried-and-true basic recipe and technique, but a few different ingredients are added to create a new family favorite.. It requires 2 cups all-purpose flour ; \u00bd cup white sugar ; 1 tablespoon baking powder ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 1 cup frozen blueberries ; \u00bd cup white chocolate chips ; \u00bd cup heavy cream ; 1 large egg ; \u00bd teaspoon maple extract ; \u00bd cup unsalted butter, frozen ; 3 tablespoons heavy cream ; 1 cup confectioners' sugar ; \u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract ; 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add frozen blueberries and white chocolate chips; stir until evenly distributed and blueberries are coated. Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, egg, and maple extract together in a small bowl. Remove butter from the freezer and grate onto a plate with a box grater. (I recommend using the biggest size grating side.) Add butter to the flour mixture and toss a couple of times to evenly distribute and cover the butter pieces. Drizzle cream-egg mixture over the flour mixture while stirring. Continue tossing until incorporated, about 30 seconds; dough will be shaggy at this point. Work dough with your hands until it forms a single mass. Lift and place dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a 1-inch thick circle. Use a knife or scraper to cut dough into 8 triangular-shaped pieces. Place scones onto the prepared baking sheet, about 1/2 inch to 1 inch apart. Brush the tops with remaining 3 tablespoons heavy cream. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until they can be handled but are still warm, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Slowly add milk, stirring until you get a drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over the warm scones, back and forth in a zig-zag pattern. Arrange scones on a dish and allow glaze to set for 5 to 10 minutes before serving."

        "answer": "Greek Easter Eggs is I found how to make this dye online, but I changed the technique because I did not get good results that way. The first Easter that I celebrated with my husband's family was wonderful. After Easter dinner, a tray of red-dyed hard-boiled eggs was placed on the table. (The deep red eggs remind us of the blood of Christ.) Everyone chose one egg and then paired up two-by-two. Taking the eggs and matching fat or pointed end to end, as they said 'Christos Anesti' they tapped the ends of the eggs together and whoever's egg remained unbroken 'won'. This continued (both ends of the egg can be used as long as matching ends tap each other) until the last person had at least one end of their egg in tact. This was a fun and joy-filled way to help celebrate.. It requires 5 cups water ; 12  yellow onions, skins removed and reserved ; 2 tablespoons white vinegar ; 12  eggs ;   olive oil. Combine water, onion skins, and vinegar in a pot; bring to a boil. Set aside onions for another use. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure skins are submerged, for 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat, remove cover, and cool dye to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Remove skins from dye and discard skins. Place eggs in the dye and bring to a boil; cook for 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat and leave eggs in the dye until a deep red color is reached, about 30 minutes more. Transfer eggs to a wire rack to dry, about 15 minutes. Rub olive oil onto each egg to make them shiny. Store eggs in the refrigerator."

        "answer": "Savory Cream Cheese and Pineapple Party Dip is This is one of my \"back pocket\" recipes for a quick and tasty party dip. I've had people ask me if it is chicken salad, because the pineapple adds a texture that is similar to shredded chicken, and the savory ingredients mask the pineapple flavor. It's perfect for a little bite before a meal or a satisfying afternoon snack on your favorite crackers. If you like, you can sneak in some vegetables, and serve it on celery sticks, or those little tri-color mini bell peppers, cut in half.. It requires 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened ; 1 (8 ounce) can canned crushed pineapple, drained ; 1 cup chopped pecans ; \u00bd cup chopped green bell pepper ; 2 tablespoons chopped green onion ; 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Combine cream cheese, crushed pineapple, pecans. bell pepper, most of the green onion, and salt in a bowl, reserving some of the green onion tops for garnish. Serve immediately if desired with reserved green onions sprinkled over, or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve."

My mother clipped this recipe from somewhere and it became a specialty of mine; however, I've been unable to find the original source.. It requires 1 pound beef top sirloin steak ; \u00bc cup soy sauce ; 2 tablespoons white sugar ; 2 tablespoons cornstarch ; \u00bd teaspoon ground ginger ; 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided ; 1  red onion, cut into 1-inch squares ; 1  green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares ; 2  tomatoes, cut into wedges. Slice the steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain. Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place the steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and place 1/3 of the steak strips into the hot oil. Cook and stir until the beef is well-browned, about 3 minutes, and remove the beef from the wok to a bowl. Repeat twice more, with the remaining beef, and set the cooked beef aside. Return all the cooked beef to the hot wok, and stir in the onion. Toss the beef and onion together until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in the green pepper. Cook and stir the mixture until the pepper has turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes, stir everything together, and serve."

And it's way more fun than buying it frozen from the store.. It requires 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading ; 5 teaspoons olive oil ; \u00bd teaspoon fine salt ; 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar ; \u00be cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C)) ; \u00bd cup cornstarch ; 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour. Place 2 cups flour in a mixing bowl; make a well in the center. Drizzle in olive oil and add salt; add white wine vinegar and warm water. Mix until dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer dough ball to a lightly floured work surface. Knead until dough is smooth, using just enough flour to keep it from sticking to the work surface or your hands, 2 or 3 minutes. Continue to knead until dough is supple and elastic, about 5 more minutes. Wrap dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. Divide dough into 20 (20 gram) portions using a kitchen scale; roll each portion into a ball. Place on plate and cover with plastic wrap to prevent dough balls from drying out while you begin to roll them out. Work in batches of 5. Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons flour together in a bowl. Dust a work surface and the first dough ball with the cornstarch mixture. Flatten out the dough ball and roll out into a circle, about 5 inches in diameter. Dust again with cornstarch mixture. Set circle to one side. Roll out 4 more dough balls to about the same diameter and stack them on the first one, dusting each layer with more of the cornstarch mixture to keep them from sticking together. When you have 5 circles, roll out the stack to a larger circle about double in size, turning as you go to maintain a round shape. Separate each layer and lay out the circles. Re-apply more cornstarch mixture where needed and restack them. Roll again until the 5-layer stack is paper thin, about 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place on a sheet of parchment paper; top with another piece of parchment. Gently roll up the dough; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining 15 balls of dough in batches of 5."

Continue to knead until dough is supple and elastic, about 5 more minutes. Wrap dough ball in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. 3. Use a kitchen scale to divide dough into twenty 20-gram portions; roll each portion into a ball. Place on a plate and cover with plastic wrap to prevent dough balls from drying out while you begin to roll them out. Work in batches of 5. 4. Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons flour together in a bowl. Dust a work surface and the first dough ball with cornstarch mixture; flatten and roll out into a circle, about 5 inches in diameter. Dust again with cornstarch mixture. Set circle to one side. Roll out 4 more dough balls to about the same diameter and stack them on the first one, dusting each layer with more cornstarch mixture to keep them from sticking together. 5. When you have 5 circles, roll out the stack to a larger circle about double in size, turning as you go to maintain a round shape. Separate each layer and lay out the circles. Reapply more cornstarch mixture where needed and restack them. Roll again until the 5-layer stack is paper-thin, about 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place on a sheet of parchment paper; top with another piece of parchment. Gently roll up the dough; wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate. 6. Repeat with the remaining 15 balls of dough in batches of 5."

        "answer": "Classic Meatloaf is The secrets to this meatloaf are fresh, very finely diced vegetables that give it moisture and flavor--and a light touch in mixing together the ingredients. This hearty meatloaf is the perfect meal for cool fall and winter evenings, served with mashed potatoes and simple mushroom gravy.. It requires 1  carrot, coarsely chopped ; 1 rib celery, coarsely chopped ; \u00bd  onion, coarsely chopped ; \u00bd  red bell pepper, coarsely chopped ; 4  white mushrooms, coarsely chopped ; 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped ; 2\u2009\u00bd pounds ground chuck ; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce ; 1  egg, beaten ; 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs ; 2 teaspoons salt ; 1 teaspoon ground black pepper ; \u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper ; 1 cup plain bread crumbs ; 1 teaspoon olive oil ; 2 tablespoons brown sugar ; 2 tablespoons ketchup ; 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard ;   hot pepper sauce to taste. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the carrot, celery, onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor, and pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a puree. Place the minced vegetables into a large mixing bowl, and mix in ground chuck, Worcestershire sauce, and egg. Add Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate vegetables and egg into the meat. Pour in bread crumbs. With your hand, gently mix in the crumbs with your fingertips just until combined, about 1 minute. Form the meatloaf into a ball. Pour olive oil into a baking dish and place the ball of meat into the dish. Shape the ball into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce. Stir until the brown sugar has dissolved. Remove the meatloaf from the oven. With the back of a spoon, smooth the glaze onto the top of the meatloaf, then pull a little bit of glaze down the sides of the meatloaf with the back of the spoon. Return meatloaf to oven, and bake until the loaf is no longer pink inside and the glaze has baked onto the loaf, 30 to 40 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf."

        "question": "How do you make Classic Meatloaf?",
        "answer": "1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil. 2. Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a puree. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. 3. Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined. Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix. 4. Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan. 5. Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes. 6. Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until brown sugar has dissolved. 7. Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then pull a tiny bit glaze down the sides. 8. Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that temperature. 9. Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Baklava?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Baklava is I tend to enjoy a generous ratio between nuts and pastry, as that makes me feel a little bit better about the copious amounts of sugar in this, but above and beyond that, I think this approach produces the best texture. You can use as many layers of filo as you want, but be careful, since too many may not cook through, and the only way to mess this up is to undercook the dough. The top and bottom layers need to dry out, and thoroughly crisp up, otherwise, once the syrup gets ladled over, you'll have a soggy mess.. It requires 2\u2009\u00bd cups walnut halves ; 1 cup shelled pistachios ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons ground cinnamon ; \u00bd cup unsalted butter, melted ; 12 sheets phyllo dough, thawed if frozen ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups sugar ; \u00be cup water ; \u00bc cup honey ; 3  whole cloves ; \u00bc teaspoon vanilla extract ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons orange flower water. Place walnuts, pistachios, and cinnamon in bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until mixture is chopped but not too fine. Brush bottom of 9-inch round baking pan with melted butter. Place one round of phyllo dough in the pan; add a second round of dough. Drip about 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top. Add 2 more sheets and drizzle with butter. Add 2 more sheets and drip with butter creating 6 layers for the bottom. (While you work keep the phyllo sheets covered with a damp, nearly dry, cotton towel to keep dough from drying out.) Sprinkle with 1/3 of the nut mixture. Top with a sheet of phyllo and drip with melted butter; repeat with 1 more sheet of filo. Add another 1/3 of the nut mixture. Place another sheet of phyllo on the nuts; drip with butter. Top with another sheet and drip with butter. Add the remaining nut mixture. Top with 2 sheets of phyllo; drip with butter. Add 2 more sheets; drip with butter. Top with the last 2 sheets and drizzle generously with the remaining butter. Cover pan with plastic and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut baklava into about 12 diamond-shaped pieces approximately the same size. Bake in preheated oven until browned and crisp, about an hour. Place sugar, honey, and cloves in a saucepan. Pour in water. Place pan over medium-high heat and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and orange blossom water. After baklava has rested 5 minutes, ladle syrup over the top. Cool down to room temperature before serving."

Halfway through my first arepa, one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, and salty cheese, I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your favorite fillings. I went with some spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.. It requires 2\u2009\u00bd cups lukewarm water ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N.\u00ae) ; \u00bc cup vegetable oil, or as needed. Stir water and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough. Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle. Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket."

        "answer": "Best Toffee Ever - Super Easy is Chocolate and almonds top off a rich buttery toffee. A simple recipe that you could easily remember and whip up any time. I always get compliments and requests for more. Use any type of nut that you like in place of the almonds.. It requires 2 cups butter ; 2 cups white sugar ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips ; 1 cup finely chopped almonds. In a large heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted. Allow to come to a boil, and cook until the mixture becomes a dark amber color, and the temperature has reached 285 degrees F (137 degrees C). Stir occasionally. While the toffee is cooking, cover a large baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. As soon as the toffee reaches the proper temperature, pour it out onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the chocolate over the top, and let it set for a minute or two to soften. Spread the chocolate into a thin even layer once it is melted. Sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate, and press in slightly. Putting a plastic bag over your hand will minimize the mess. Place the toffee in the refrigerator to chill until set.

        "question": "What is the recipe for Basic Curry Sauce?",
        "answer": "Basic Curry Sauce is This is a very versatile Indian curry sauce that can be served as a main course with meats and/or vegetables or as a sauce for dipping or to spice up veggie side dishes.  It's great over baked potatoes.. It requires 2 tablespoons peanut oil ; 1 tablespoon margarine ; 1 large onion, chopped ; 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root ; 2 tablespoons minced garlic ; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ; 1 teaspoon ground black pepper ; 2 tablespoons ground coriander ; 2 tablespoons ground cumin ; \u00bc teaspoon ground turmeric ; 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper ; 2  tomatoes ; 2  serrano chile peppers, seeded ; \u00bd cup fresh cilantro ; \u00bd cup yogurt, whisked until smooth ; 3 cups water. Heat oil and margarine in a small skillet or wok over medium high heat. Add onion and saute until very brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Note: This is an important step; if onion is not cooked well, sauce will taste funny.) Add ginger and garlic to onion and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Process onion/ginger/garlic mixture in food processor until smooth. Do not rinse food processor. Place onion mixture in a large saucepan. Stir in the cinnamon, black pepper, coriander, cumin, turmeric and cayenne pepper and cook over low heat until mixture is thick and has the consistency of a paste. Puree tomatoes, chile peppers and cilantro in food processor until smooth. Add to onion mixture and stir well over low heat, cooking off moisture from tomatoes and cilantro. Add yogurt a little bit at a time, stirring constantly to avoid curdling. Blend the whole mixture in food processor to puree it (for a very smooth sauce). Return to saucepan, add water and increase heat to high; bring sauce to a rolling boil. Cover saucepan and boil for 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until desired consistency is reached. To serve with meat, cook the meat first separately, then simmer for 5 to 10 minutes in the sauce before serving over rice or with bread.    To serve with vegetables, steam raw veggies first 4 to 5 minutes, then simmer for 5 to 10 minutes in the sauce before serving."

        "answer": "The Best Baked Ziti is I am half Italian, was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, and have filmed almost 2000 recipe videos, so when you consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I have never posted a video for baked ziti. Hopefully I make up for that long wait by posting what I think is the best version of it.. It requires \u00be pound hot Italian sausage ; \u00be pound sweet Italian sausage ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 1 large yellow onion, diced ; \u00bd teaspoon dried oregano ; \u00bc teaspoon dried thyme ; \u00bc teaspoon dried rosemary ; 2 (24 ounce) jars prepared marinara sauce ; 2 cups water ; 1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta ; 1 drizzle olive oil ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups whole-milk ricotta cheese ; 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes ; 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese ; 1 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, or to taste. Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. Remove and discard casings. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. Add sausages and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until the sausage begins to brown, and the onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in marinara sauce. Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Turn off heat and reserve until needed. Before using, skim any excess fat that rises to the surface. While sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 or 2 minutes less than the directions on the package call for, about 8 minutes. Drain well and transfer into a large mixing bowl. Carefully add the meat sauce and stir until thoroughly combined. Let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large 9x15-inch or 9x13-inch casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil. Use a slotted spoon to transfer half of the pasta and sauce mixture to the prepared dish, then use a spatula to even out into a uniform layer. Top with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and then 1/2 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, being sure to distribute evenly. Top with the rest of the pasta and sauce mixture and give the pan a little shake to settle the sauce. Repeat the cheese application. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the casserole is piping hot, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

        "answer": "Santa Maria Grilled Tri-Tip Beef is The town of Santa Maria, California, is home to one of America's most delicious barbecue specialties: black-on-the-outside, pink-on-the-inside, grilled beef tri-tip steak. The tri-tip is cut from the bottom sirloin, and if cooked properly produces a very flavorful, extremely juicy piece of beef.. It requires 2 teaspoons salt ; 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper ; 2 teaspoons garlic powder ; 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons paprika ; 1 teaspoon onion powder ; 1 teaspoon dried rosemary ; \u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper ; 1 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast ; \u2153 cup red wine vinegar ; \u2153 cup vegetable oil ; 4 cloves crushed garlic ; \u00bd teaspoon Dijon mustard. Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Place beef in a glass baking dish and coat beef on all sides with spice mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours. Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard together in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake to blend ingredients. Remove beef from refrigerator, uncover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place meat on preheated grill and brush with garlic-vinegar mixture. Cook meat for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Repeat the flip and baste process every 4 minutes until beef starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing."
